Hello internet friends!

Everything you need to know about the celebrity image hack is over here at [Playboy.com](http://www.playboy.com/articles/jennifer-lawrence-nudes).[^playboy]

Remember how [I stopped using Facebook](http://irregularity.co/62-oh-hoh-hoh-hoah/)? Yeah? Good times. In my quest to find the magic that the "early"[^early] web was to me, I also decided to quit Twi… wait, no. But I decided to finally - *finally* - deactivate all the emails that Twitter keeps sending me. Of course there would be a lot less of those if I didn't have a whole bunch of one-joke joke accounts.

[^early]: I already felt that I was late to the party when I got there, tbh.

Alan Jacobs claims that [Big Twitter is over](http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2014/08/the-end-of-big-twitter.html). His article is a lot smarter than "Big Twitter is over" so if you're into that sort of thing, it's worth reading. And so are the articles he links to. And those that they link to.  
Wow, it's almost as if this blog thing is not such a bad idea after all.

~~

In case you were wondering, here are the articles he links to:

* Marco Arment: [Worked things out with The Wirecutter](http://www.marco.org/2014/08/29/wirecutter-resolved)
* Brent Simmons: [On Taking Breaks](http://inessential.com/2014/08/29/on_taking_breaks)
* Frank Chimero: [From the Porch to the Street](http://frankchimero.com/blog/from-the-porch-to-the-street/)
* Hang: [Social Software Sundays #2 – The Evaporative Cooling Effect](http://blog.bumblebeelabs.com/social-software-sundays-2-the-evaporative-cooling-effect/)

~~

And in case you were really wondering: Twitter is still very much "my internet porch" and I am still pretty happy when I see that people I meet somewhere are active on it. A lot of this has to do with Tweetbot, though. Without its mute feature and the fact that it is just running there on my desktop, acting as a sort-of but-not-really chat room and window into the world, it might just not be all that interesting.

Anyway, wednesday!

Have a good one.
