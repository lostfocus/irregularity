Hello, internet friends!

I am sure you guys missed me already - it has been a few days. Mostly it has been a few pretty warm days, which had the nice result of me basically shutting down all my systems and just sort of stay above consciousness for a while.  
Did I mention that I like it when it's that warm? I really do.

Well, while I dared to not do anything, PSY (Psy?) released "Hangover" - together with Snoop Dogg. I watched [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkMNOlYcpHg) and by now, I have already forgotten how the music goes. I do remember a lot of [drinking](http://www.eatyourkimchi.com/a-drinking-guide-to-psys-hangover/), though. [A lot!](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/11/world/asia/psy-snoop-dogg-new-video/index.html) Now I'm waiting for the GIFs to pop up.

On the weekend I did what everybody seems to be doing these days: experiment around my with my coffee consumption. Specifically, since it is warm outside, I wanted to try cold brewing coffee. Since I have no way of measuring anything I just shoveled ground coffee beans in a pitcher, filled the pitcher with water and put it in the fridge for a night. On Sunday morning I french-pressed them and voila - had cold and pretty weak cold coffee.  
The second experiment was with double the ground beans and the result was not pretty - I broke my French Press, because the coffee was that thick.

I also tried to bake [tortas de aceite](http://www.instructables.com/id/tortas-de-aceite-sweet-spanish-flatbreads/?ALLSTEPS). Once again - I have nothing to measure anything, so I sort of guessed. "Yeah, that looks like 360g of flour." I also replaced a bunch of ingredients.  
Ehm.  
So I ended up with weird cookies, that looked and tasted nothing like proper tortas.

How are you guys doing?
