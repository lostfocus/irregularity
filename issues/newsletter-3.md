*Wednesday's newsletter was a bit wonky, I want to apologize for that. It's probably going to happen again. And even though I tend to blame myself for everything that goes wrong, in this case I want to point to the computer and curse. Because it's there and because there is nothing it can do about it. Yet. Once it can, we're all fucked.*

**1.0 Motivate!**
 
I really don't understand motivational quotes or posters. Yet everybody else seems to love them. There is a company that prints them for startups. There are many different people who post them on Facebook and Tumblr and Twitter. 
 
I don't get it. Does it really help people when a lossy JPG or a crummy print-to-order poster tells them to keep going? I can't for the love of whatever deity one might chose to believe in understand the thought process that is going on in that moment.
 
> Oh, the expense report that I just filed had a typo in it, so my boss yelled at me. But here is that picture of a kitten in boxing gloves that says 'Keep fighting' so all is well!
 
Really?
 
The only thing that works for me is people who tell me once in a while that I am not such a terrible person. And do it convincingly enough that I believe them. Luckily I have some of those, so thanks for that.
 
But a JPG with a garish color gradient that tells me that tomorrow is another day?
 
Oh, fuck off.

**2.0 Vanished**

For what it's worth, my two sources for news about the vanished Malaysia Airlines flight are this (long!) [MeFi thread](http://www.metafilter.com/137298/MH370-missing#5465401) and [this blog.](http://whereismh370.com/)

**3.0 Monday**

Have a good start into the week and take care, everyone.
