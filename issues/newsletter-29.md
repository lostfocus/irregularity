# 1.0 Forgotten

No, this is not about [that court decision regarding Google](http://qz.com/208860/europe-will-let-its-citizens-edit-google-search-results-for-their-names/) nor is it about the news stories from last week.[^lastweek]

[^lastweek]: Seriously, what did we care about last week?

This morning I realised[^again] that I immediately forget anything that I don't write down, complete with a reminder and/or an entry in my calendar. (Yes, I know - nothing new for listeners of [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/73).) 

[^again]: Probably again. I have forgotten.

This can be a problem, because quite often I tend to forget (hah!) to create a reminder or a calendar entry. And this is a problem that can only be solved with something called "discipline" - a concept that people tell me about and that I only vaguely understand.  
So I guess I'll be okay with sometimes learning that I have an appointment later in the week that I made half a year ago. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Well, actually, stop the shrugging right there - it is something I was really good at and lost due to my sudden overreliance on "the cloud" - so it should be possible to retrain myself.

Or (warning, community manager power trick!) what do you folks think? Have any good ideas on how to handle reminders and remembering these things?

# 2.0 Links!

## 2.1 iMessage

So, if you changed from an iOS device to a non-iOS device, things get ugly with your [text messages](http://adampash.com/imessage-purgatory/). 

## 2.2 Generations

There is now the ['pay-as-you-live' generation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10810304/Are-you-part-of-the-pay-as-you-live-generation.html) and the [satori generation](https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/113/satori-generation.html) and never forget about the millenials.  
It's fascinating, really.  

## 2.3 Privilege

An [interview with Peggy McIntosh](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html), the person who coined the sociological term "privilege" and who is very apparently a lot smarter (and kinder) than those kids over on Tumblr. (But then she has the privilege of being a nice old lady, so that's that.)

I had enough sleep last night, yet I am extremely tired today. Something must be done about this.  

Have a nice day… I think it's Wednesday?
