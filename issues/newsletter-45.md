Hello, internet friends!

I was about to write "Good Morning" but who am I to know at what time of day you are reading this email.

◔̯◔

It has been a while, but mostly because I have **nothing to add to the global conversation**.  
And as you know, my expectations are always very high and while [my religion](http://dudeism.com/) has a wide open heart for achievers, it's also pretty important to take it easy.

And yes, I did re-watch The Big Lebowski last night. For reasons.

Talking about achieving - I am "active" as a member of [The Little Lebowski Urban Achievers Lending Team](http://www.kiva.org/team/dudeism)  on Kiva. Maybe you [want to join](http://www.kiva.org/invitedby/dominik) and help people achieve, too?

No funny stuff.

Now why would I even want to add something to the *global conversation*? It is usually stupid, because [people are stupid](http://xkcd.com/1386/).  
(Bonus points if you can spot the recursion.)

You will probably not have noticed it, but the world must have ended - I just started following a *brand* on Instagram. Given that the *brand* in question is [National Geographic](http://instagram.com/natgeo), I guess I can be excused. Right? They got me with the [apes](http://instagram.com/p/ppEWtpIVRs/).

Take care,

Dominik
