# 1.0 Link Link Link

*Okay, let's try something different: a bunch of links to stuff I liked.*

## 1.1 Stage

You know what's good? Marc Maron's WTF podcast. You know which episode I really enjoyed this weekend? [The one with Josh Radnor](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_484_-_josh_radnor), who seems to be quite a swell guy.

## 1.2 (Like a Record)

Priceonomics on [Why UPS trucks don't turn left](http://priceonomics.com/why-ups-trucks-dont-turn-left/). Spoiler alert: they still turn left once in a while.

## 1.3 History

Marco Arment on ["Political Views"](http://www.marco.org/2014/04/04/political-views) - if that is the result of John Siracusa [prodding him towards speaking up on non-tech, non-coffee issues](http://atp.fm/episodes/57-smorgasbord-of-pronunciation), I am all for it.

## 1.4 Click click click

Really good documentation about the 2011 DotA2 tournament in Cologne: [Free to Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZYMI1zB9s). Completely worth the time if you're interested in professional gaming or even just like good documentations.

# 2.0 I'm (not) prepared to let you go

I am using Twitter - a lot. And I follow way too many people. And yet I love it - here's how: The "Mute" function in Tweetbot. I blanket-mute *everything* that is annoying. Keywords, oh so many keywords. A whole bunch of apps. A few urls. A whole bunch of people.
My rule for muting people is pretty easy: for any really stupid and/or sports-related tweet I mute people for a week.  
I know I could just unfollow people, but I don't actually want to - some people are just randomly stupid and/or interested in sports and I might want to read their usual tweets some time later on and this is a pretty elegant way to do so.

# 3.0 Game of Codes

So there is a new season of "Game of Thrones" ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY43QSx3Fk)) and a new series called "Silicon Valley" ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69V__a49xtw)) and I am excited.

Have a good start to the week.
