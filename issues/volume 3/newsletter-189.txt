Hello internet friends,

apparently [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmsxWmKz-B8) is a commercial, but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ it is also great *content*.

Sometimes things that used to be there are suddenly not there anymore. These things usually are not [sunk warships](http://qz.com/838795/three-dutch-wwii-ships-sunk-in-1942-have-completely-vanished-from-the-ocean-floor/), though. Well - it might be time to learn about [low-background steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel) to understand why these things are probably pretty valuable scrap material.  
It still boggles my mind a bit how the market for stuff like that works.

We covered robot sex here [before](http://irregularity.co/30-internet-of-clothes/). (Which was disturbing, apparently. At least it wasn't [muppets](http://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-why-disney-is-the-proud-owner-of-muppetfucker-net-1788923370).) Now we are watching Westworld and go :thinking_face: - how ethical is it really to do things to appliances?  
And maybe, while we're at it - [what about VR?](http://www.vocativ.com/374704/vr-sex-ethics/)

Uh-oh, you're old! [And so is ICQ](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/happy-20th-birthday-icq/), which is still around. idk, somehow things were a lot better when that one was still *the* thing to use. After all we didn't have [that crap](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-far-right-is-a-meme) on there.

Oh man, I certainly did not miss [the cold war](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/). And at the moment it seems like the propaganda - or as we call it these days: post-truth - is winning on [all fronts](https://medium.com/@xuhulk/watching-the-election-from-the-post-truth-future-97a0d66bdcfe).

Toodles.
