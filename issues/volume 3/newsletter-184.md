Hello internet friends!

Did you know that being rich is boring when nobody sees you? Yeah, well, me neither. It's the slogan of a new app called [Rich Kids](https://richkids.life/) which is exactly as terrible as it sounds.  
I don't know. For some reason I prefer our little gathering of [Smart Kids](http://smartkids.life) right here.

I watched [Being George Clooney](http://www.beinggeorgeclooney.com/) this weekend, a documentary about dubbing movies and featuring a whole lot of people from all over the world who are the voice of George Clooney and his female co-stars. (They could have just called it "Being Julia Roberts" - wtf?) I have linked to t[his article about dubbing Seinfeld](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8809723/jerry-seinfeld-tv-show-international-translation) [before](http://irregularity.co/18-abroad/) but I did not know that [the Italians are crazy about their dubbers](http://harpers.org/blog/2012/05/the-real-lives-of-italian-dubbers/).

At some point I want to visit Shenzen. You wonder why? [Wonder no more.](https://shift.newco.co/what-50-buys-you-at-huaqiangbei-the-worlds-most-fascinating-electronics-market-f0384d9fca32)

Before I write these emails I really need a healthy amount of [the healing power of crystals](https://medium.com/@rudehunch/sentences-where-the-word-coffee-has-been-replaced-with-the-healing-power-of-crystals-7526ddb8eff4). Maybe that would [help Rinna](http://fusion.net/story/354288/rinna-microsoft-depressed/) as well? If not, [there's always Molly](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21708655-new-generation-drugs-could-change-way-depression-treated-novel-drugs).

[This story](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/79-boy-in-photo/) somehow gets weirder and weirder. (Warning: it's a podcast episode, so you'll probably have to listen to it. They do have a full transcript, but I found that a bit hard to read.)

So, [these daydreams](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/10/what-its-like-to-be-a-maladaptive-daydreamer.html) - it's not just me?  
This poor lady in the interview sounds like she's having these a lot more than I ever did, though.

The [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) used to be a pretty theoretical thing to ponder - how often are we in situations where we get to decide where a trolley will roll, anyway? But these days, designers and developers of self-driving cars will have to think about that. A lot. There's this [webpage](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/) where you do a couple of decisions and see for yourself. (I have [my own kind of resultâ€¦](http://solipsism.eu/post/151383219860/moral-machine))  
If you're working at Mercedes Benz, the answer to these questions is [a little bit easier](https://www.fastcoexist.com/3064539/self-driving-mercedes-will-be-programmed-to-sacrifice-pedestrians-to-save-the-driver).

Wow. This is already a long mail. Do you still have the energy for more? Weeeell, let's do this, in a quickfire way:
