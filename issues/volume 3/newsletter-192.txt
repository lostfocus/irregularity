Hello internet friends,

good news! We finally have tangible proof that [dinosaurs were big ducks](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-this-99-million-year-old-dinosaur-tail-ended-up-in-a-burmese-amber-market). I mean, we already *knew* deep in our hearts, but it's nice to be able to point at some actual feathers and say: "See!"

So, by now we've all watched Westworld, right? (Right?)  
I mean, whew, what a season finale - who'd have thought it's all a dream and he was just taking a shower? Anyway. If you can't wait for the next season or until we finally have proper real robots, why not travel to South Dakota and [visit Cowboy Town](http://www.vice.com/read/1880-cowboy-town-oh-hell-no)?

Space! Ever since we humans decided that we want to go there, it's littered with random space junk. (Like everywhere we go.) Now a bunch of Japanese scientists had a smart idea: [make a big-ass net and collect that stuff](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38265676). Sounds like a good plan to me.

We're big fans of Lego here at the Irregularity HQ (wow, way to make it sound pretentious. There's just me. There's no HQ. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯) and so of course this article hits a nerve: [Lego Is the Perfect Toy](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/12/lego-is-the-perfect-toy.html).  

This orchid might not be an orchid. In fact [it's a mantis.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/orchid-mantises-evolution-insects/) Fascinating and slightly creepy.

Toodles.
