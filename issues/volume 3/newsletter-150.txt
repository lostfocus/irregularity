Hello internet friends,

did you manage to read all the articles I linked to [last week](http://irregularity.co/8-dont-trust-your-bot/)? Hm?  
If you didn't, you might want to instapaper them and take them on that trip to Cuba that you want to take [before it's ruined](http://floodmagazine.com/34721/please-stop-saying-you-want-to-go-to-cuba-before-its-ruined/).

If you read this chances are that you have given me your email address at some point for exactly that reason: that I can send you these letters. But what happens if [someone asks for your email address just because he wants it](https://medium.com/@mattgiovanisci/how-i-increased-my-email-subscriber-rate-95-19-by-just-asking-nicely-5cc2a5e62ab7)?

I wanted to link to [this article](http://qz.com/674031/radiohead-and-thom-yorke-have-erased-themselves-from-the-internet/) for the pretty funny last paragraph, but then I realized it's not actually that funny and it's about some marketing stunt for a band that I don't particularly care about. So… meh.

Talking about meta-commentary - a *lot* of people tweeted that [Why So Many Smart People Aren’t Happy](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/why-so-many-smart-people-arent-happy/479832/) article and oh boy, is it obvious why. Because it lets people look at their own miserable sad lives and go: "Hmm, well, that must be because I am so smart!"  
Of course that's not true for all of you, you are all very smart, but try to keep it in mind - it's a fun little pattern to observe.

Now I am not so sure, though - does that mean that [Danes are not very smart](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12383/abstract)?

Another article that *everybody* linked to last week was [Uncanny Valley](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/) and oh boy, this is a great one. Very well written and amusing if you think that "Silicon Valley" is a too positive look at the internet industry. (You are watching "Silicon Valley", right?)

Now a link for people who make websites: [The history of ‘this website is well-crafted’ hints](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/well-crafted-websites/) - well, true. I might need to look into the whole serviceworker thing.  
Now a link for people who (play and) watch StarCraft II: [The life of Life: Chronicling the rise and fall of Lee "Life" Seung Hyun](http://espn.go.com/esports/story/_/id/15356948) - this one is pretty sad. An extremely gifted player, stopped by his addiction.  
Now a link for people who think about Social Media: [The Feed Is Dying](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/04/the-feed-is-dying.html) - ugh. But true.  
Now a link for people who use batteries: [Researchers have accidentally made batteries that could last 400 times longer](http://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-accidentally-made-batteries-that-last-400-times-longer) - by "last longer" they mean "more cycles" and not "only need to be recharged every month."

Toodles!

PS: Ahem. Why did no-one tell me I have written "Vol.2" for the last couple of emails?
