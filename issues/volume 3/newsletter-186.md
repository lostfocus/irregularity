Hello internet friends,

this email is going to be quite a task today. Most bookmarks I collected during the week are MacBook-related and honestly, it's a bit too depressing to link to those now. Here's [one with all the links to all the articles](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/), soâ€¦ go nuts. And then there's [this one, which at least made me laugh](https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/10/benjamin_button_reviews_the_new_macbook_pro/).  
And if [this article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13452084/microsoft-apple-new-pc-surface-macbook-prices-expensive-exclusive) is true (ugh, I do link to these articles now, do I? Sorry.) I'll be one unhappy person in the future. If someone told me that I had to get rid of *all* my digital things except for one, I'd not even have to think too much to keep my current MBP.

Ugh. Kinda boring to think about these things, isn't it, though?

I am pretty sure this dude does not think much about computers - all he wants to do is [be Indiana Jones and solve the mystery of that Malaysian airplane that vanished](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20161021-the-man-solving-malaysia-flight-370).

Important dinosaur news! Not only did they have feathers - we can all agree on that - they [also quacked and cooed](http://nerdist.com/dinosaurs-didnt-roar-they-cooed-or-quacked-like-ducks-says-new-study/). And we all know the [duck test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test) - if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

Well - if it looks like a truck and drives like a truck, it might actually be a truck. And pretty soon these things will drive by themselves. Either in [a very serious way](http://www.daimler.com/innovation/autonomous-driving/freightliner-inspiration-truck.html) or just [for a beer run](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/).  
Which is always a good way to get technology working. Maybe the pursuit of getting drunk faster might have been the driving force behind new technologies? Or maybe it was just [good old competition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/28/why-the-industrial-revolution-didnt-happen-in-china/).

Scientists often use camera traps to study wildlife - motion-activated cameras can be great to take photos of elusive animals that might be hidden from human photographers. [Sometimes these animals are *really* strange, though.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wildife-camera-trap-shoots-rare-footage-of-naked-human)

[And then there's the giraffe.](http://nautil.us/issue/41/selection/how-necking-shaped-the-giraffe-rp)

Toodles!
