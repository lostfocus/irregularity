Hello internet friends,

this weekend I didn't do anything but watch [a digger digging a hole](https://holidayhole.com/). Thanks a lot.  
(Well, not quite: for those of you who understand German and listen to podcasts - [I did that again](http://dickehipster.de/2016/11/27/11-2016/), after quite a while.)

Nothing sounds like a better idea like "[Uber for Mental Health](http://www.vice.com/read/this-app-is-like-uber-but-for-happy-givers)" - especially not when it's from a bunch of dudes who
"intend to do a lot of neat things with the collected data."

Meanwhile in the department of *rich people being rich*:[ Virgin's Richard Branson Unveils a Plane That Travels from London to NYC in 3.5 Hours](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/virgins-richard-branson-unveils-plane)  
As a big fan of the Concorde this is something I'll keep watching - let's see if they manage to get around the problems the Concorde had.

This is rather awesome: [Two Teenage Girls Built Africa's First-Ever Private Satellite](https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/13820-africa-s-first-private-sattelite)  
Go for it, young space girls!

If you have a bit of time - and you probably do, given that this email is a bit short - you might want to learn about [Sima Qian, the first proper Chinese historian.](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2016/11/history-is-written-by-losers.html)

Toodles.
