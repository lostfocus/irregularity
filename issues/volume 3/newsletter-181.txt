Hello internet friends,

have you taken a selfie today, yet? It might be [a good idea to do so](http://www.bustle.com/articles/184151-selfies-are-linked-to-happiness-study-shows-and-its-one-more-reason-to-stop-selfie-shaming), though.  
Find your angle, work your angle. (Obviously the "study" is a bit baloney, but since I am pro-selfie in general, I will proudly link to it, saying: a-ha! [confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)!)

While we slowly adapt to the idea of self-driving cars, Amsterdam takes the whole idea a step further and develops small [self-driving canal barges](http://qz.com/785509/scientists-from-mit-and-the-delft-university-of-technology-are-building-self-driving-boats-in-amsterdam/) that can either be used as boats or form a pontoon bridge.

There are two airline commercials which I rather like. One is actually really good - [the "Campari Soda" one for Swiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq7o-y1jpT8) - while [the other is a bit silly in its new-agey vibe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxQ4hBwp4Q4). And of course, because it's 2016, it is [not only a bit silly but *problematic.*](https://theawl.com/an-aural-history-of-adiemus-89a7727e15e7)

You know what's getting cheaper and cheaper? [Solar energy, that's what.](http://rameznaam.com/2016/09/21/new-record-low-solar-price-in-abu-dhabi-costs-plunging-faster-than-expected/) Especially in very sunny countries like Abu Dhabi. But, you know, it is not like we'll have the same conditions soon [anywhere else, too.](http://xkcd.com/1732/)

It seems like there are not many cryptozoologists left - I didn't really see anyone celebrating in the streets after we now _finally_ have [legitimate photographic proof of the Loch Ness monster](http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/16/photographer-spots-loch-ness-monster-and-not-three-seals-playing-together-6131884/).

The *whole* internet - well, those people who spend their time commenting New York Times opinion pieces on Twitter, which might be an indicator why this article struck a nerve - discussed this question over the weekend: [Am I Introverted, or Just Rude?](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/opinion/sunday/am-i-introverted-or-just-rude.html?_r=0)  
I don't know… do I have to pick?

[Hm.](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-technology-almost-killed-me.html)

Toodles!

Let's do some housekeeping, we have a few new faces around the table, so why not. The archive for these emails is [here](http://irregularity.co/), all 180something issues. It also is on [medium dot com](https://medium.com/irregular-archive), if that's more your thing. I've been known to engage with replies there, so… ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  
Almost every week there are links that just didn't make it into the email, for some reason or another. I collect those [over here](https://surplus.buzz/). It has a full feed, too - so if you're into RSS, then that's something for you. I think that's it for now, there is a [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/IrregularityCo) and a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/irregularityco/), too - both are there, because why not. If you get this by email, you already get it in the format it was intended to be.
