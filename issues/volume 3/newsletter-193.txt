Hello internet friends,

it is a pretty fun idea to [3D-print the The Legend of Zelda map](http://kotaku.com/original-the-legend-of-zelda-map-gets-printed-in-3d-1790229095). It is even more fun to read that the person who did it used Minecraft as the 3D tool, because of course he did.

You know what's creepy? [This thing here.](http://gatebox.ai/) - it looks like a coffee maker but somehow it has a hologram of a half-naked anime lady in it. Maybe we should really start talking about [the ethics of robotic companions](https://mic.com/articles/162206/westworld-rape-violence-abuse-sexism-sex-robots-consent-what-it-says-about-us).

It's always pretty fun to explore a city with a healthy combination of planning and seredipity. So hey, [why not do the same with Kabul](https://medium.com/studio-d/kabul-a-walking-tour-475cd607a5cf)?

Pebble was the first smartwatch company and somehow it managed to survive until a few weeks ago. Now that it is gone, Fitbit went ahead and bought their assets - and here is h[ow the whole thing looked from the inside](https://backchannel.com/the-real-story-behind-pebbles-demise-303802a7afaa).

It's a bit too simplified, but hey - why not read [this article on how spice trade roughly 4000 years ago was the precursor to globalization](https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/small-world-after-all-839e17047220)? I did and enjoyed it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

If you do internet-stuff, why not go and have a look at [this very good book](https://resilientwebdesign.com/). (Well, book-like website.) You'll probably learn something.

Toodles!
