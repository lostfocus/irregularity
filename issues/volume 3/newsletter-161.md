Hello internet friends,

apparently we all have [a whole bunch of doppelgangers](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160712-you-are-surprisingly-likely-to-have-a-living-doppelganger) running around. Which kinda makes sense - there are only so many types of faces around.  
At least mine was [one of the dudes who invented the car](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBuNxSYI5gi/).

Not only have we learned that dinosaurs were basically giant feathery chickens, now we also know that they probably [sounded a lot like them](http://gizmodo.com/dinosaurs-more-likely-cooed-than-roared-1783475658) as well.  
Could someone with a lot of time please do a re-mix of those scenes from Jurassic Park and just put chicken sounds where roars used to be? Thanks.

Apparently it is now a thing to [sue a painter](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/arts/design/peter-doig-painting-lawsuit.html) for not having painted a certain painting. This is pretty weird - at least a lot weirder than the painting itself.  
Talking about art - now [_this_ is art](http://www.boredpanda.com/giant-war-god-statue-general-guan-yu-sculpture-china/) I can really get behind.

Oh well.  
Toodles!
