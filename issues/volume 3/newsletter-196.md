Hello internet friends,

I hope you're all doing well. Me personally? Eh, [could be better](http://thoughtcatalog.com/lauren-jarvis-gibson/2016/09/11-things-people-dont-realize-you-are-doing-because-of-your-anxiety/). I could do with a hug and maybe one of those multi-week (months?) [digital detox](http://www.evelynblogs.com/blog/social-media-detox-cynical) retreats in some weird hippie commune. (Aww, man, I did have such a fun article on one of those places and I can't find it anymore. Technology! Ugh. I mean, honestly. Not even Creepy Chrome's history search is helping me. Maybe read this essay on [the 20 year anniversary of "The Beach"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/02/alex-garland-the-beach-20-years-on) from last summer instead? Idk.)  
Or maybe I'll just [become a priest](https://qz.com/879285/psilocybin-drug-trials-psychedelics-such-as-acid-lsd-might-not-only-make-us-more-spiritual-and-religious-they-make-us-healthier-too/)?

One thing that I just know will probably always stay in the stage of being a concept and yet is very fascinating to me is Personal Rapid Transit - you know, the idea of small-ish self-driving pods on dedicated little tracks. *Turns out* [the idea is not really all that new](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/24/11094524/prt-transit-history-self-driving-cars-alden-starrcar-tomorrowland-1960s) and just like so many things from that era will probably turn into a sad parody of itself.

Another fascinating thing: maps! Here is one of [Chinese merchant shipping routes](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03085694.2013.731203) from the 17th century.

Now here we go, three articles from the New Yorker that are worth reading:

1. [The Vertical Farm](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/09/the-vertical-farm) - the future!  
2. [The Voyeurs's Motel](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/11/gay-talese-the-voyeurs-motel) - wtf?
3. [A Selection of the 30 Most Disappointing Under 30](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/a-selection-of-the-30-most-disappointing-under-30) - disappointingly enough I wasn't even able to get on that list. Mostly due to my advanced age.

I've said it on Twitter before: my favourite new genre of literatur is "reviews of books by Marie Kondo" - here is one of her new book: [Did Marie Kondo's Spark bring me Joy?](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/did-marie-kondos-spark-bring-me-joy-)

Take care out there.  
Toodles!
