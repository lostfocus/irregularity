Hello internet friends,

I woke up this morning and instead of "Wah, end of the world!" my whole twitter feed was "Wah, Oscars!" - so I checked what happened and eh, [this happened](http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/27/14748228/oscar-best-picture-moonlight-la-la-land-mixup-beatty-dunaway).[^oscars]  
Honestly, why do I even mention it? It's been on every single news channel today. Just like I don't quite see how it helps when I mention the [TRAPPIST-1 planets](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2159/?linkId=34784370). You all know it. It's pretty exciting, but… eh. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

[^oscars]: If you're the one person who did not read about that this morning and don't want to click through: they actually read the wrong title for best movie, mostly because some accountant at PWC screwed up.

Maps! Apparently I was not the only child who was super happy [when a book included a map](https://theawl.com/the-maps-we-wandered-into-as-kids-e04e78255822) and a whole bunch of additional material and addenda. My personal favorite has always been the [pretty sparse map of Inner Mongolia](http://www.wfelix.org/images/muehlenweg_maps_large.jpg) from [Fritz Mühlenweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_M%C3%BChlenweg)'s *Großer-Tiger und Christian*.

[FRUiTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_(magazine)) is closing down and *of course* the reason is that Japanese street style is dead now. [DEAD I tell you.](https://qz.com/909573/japans-wild-creative-harajuku-street-style-is-dead-long-live-uniqlo/) Or maybe it just moved to some other place where it isn't being turned into a commodity for a fashion magazine? 

Fun fact! [Self-driving cars are not humans.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/driving-is-social-autonomous-cars-arent-argues-computer-scientist) At least they don't act human in any given traffic situation. While this is not entirely unexpected it is also something that will need to be addressed on mixed-used roads.

Toodles!
