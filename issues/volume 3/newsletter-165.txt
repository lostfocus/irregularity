Hello internet friends,

you know how bats tend to leave their sleeping areas in huge groups, forming big clouds and managing to do that without crashing into each other? Well, *turns out* they do [crash into each other quite a lot](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/bats-crash-into-each-other-all-the-time-high-speed-cameras-reveal). Make sure to watch the video, it is rather interesting.

More animal nerdery news - if you enjoy the deeps of the ocean, have a look at [Nautilus Live](http://nautiluslive.org/). It's a livestream of a remote controlled submarine with real-time commentary by a bunch of often rather giggly marine scientists.

When I was a child I spent my summers doing stupid stuff like trying to figure out how fast I can read The Lord of the Rings or how long I can pretend to be asleep in the morning before someone actually started to worry about me. *Turns out* there is at least one rather fascinating, yet [highly questionable alternative way for children to spend a summer](http://qz.com/752177/inside-north-koreas-propaganda-summer-camp-for-international-kids/).

[Oh, good.](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/research-suggests-being-lazy-is-a-sign-of-high-intelligence-a7176136.html)

Remember Marina Joyce from [two weeks ago](http://irregularity.co/22-coffee-and-chocolate/)? The YouTuber who suddenly was in the middle of a strange conspiracy theory? [The Guardian talked to her and her mother](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/09/internet-kidnapping-conspiracy-marina-joyce-youtube) about this weird situation.  
At least her fans only had to imagine their idol being brainwashed. [Things can be pretty different in other parts of the YouTubery.](http://mashable.com/2016/08/07/sex-lies-and-youtube/)

*Turns out* when you legalize one drug, people who profit from illegal drugs [*pivot* their business](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a46918/heroin-mexico-el-chapo-cartels-don-winslow/).

Toodles!
