Hello internet friends,

while I was pretty *pretty* pleased with last week's "[Here are ruined things](http://irregularity.co/6-ruined-by-everything/)" email I also got the feedback that ~people~ will not click on links if they are presented that way. One of my friends - an *online marketing viral content guru* (aha!) - even suggested that this format does not *convert* hence the lower *engagement* with my *content.*  
And we wouldn't want that, would we? So here we go!
