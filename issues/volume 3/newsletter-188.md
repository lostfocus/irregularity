Hello internet friends,

this is probably my fourth or fifth attempt of writing that first paragraph and nothing really works. Just imagine a whole bunch of confused anger right here. You probably don't have to - I'm almost sure you feel it too.  
And if you don't? Well, good for you.

And here are some new things for you to learn! Because learning new things is *always* a good thing. Broaden your horizon.

A bunch of archaeologists sent a submarine to the bottom of the Black Sea and what they found might surprâ€¦ Sorry.  
What they found were [the remains of more than 40 sunk ships from the last thousand years](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/science/shipwrecks-black-sea-archaeology.html). That worked because apparently there's not much oxygen down there, which helps to preserve the wrecks for such a long time. The more you know!

The [Nebra Sky Disc](http://www.businessinsider.com/nebra-sky-disk-is-oldest-depiction-of-universe-2015-1) is another artifact from a time long gone. (Or so we hope.) It was found by a bunch of looters and turned out to be [not such a lucky thing for them](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/europe/switzerland/skydisc-text.html). (Seriously, read this rather short article. It's funny and almost as exciting as a fictional thriller.)

Evolution is a funny thing. We can all agree that it is a thing - I hope. But we still haven't quite figured out how it works exactly. *Turns out* [it might not be all in the genes](https://aeon.co/essays/on-epigenetics-we-need-both-darwin-s-and-lamarck-s-theories).

There are a lot of interesting museums all around the world. One of the better ones might be the [Museum of Rocks That Look Like Faces](http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2016/11/13/the-japanese-museum-of-rocks-that-look-like-faces/). I'm not too sure what we can learn from it but it does seem like something worth looking into.

Toodles.
