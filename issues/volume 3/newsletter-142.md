Hello internet friends!

I have been doing this for two years now and it is still fun - I sincerely hope it is for you, too. Thanks for reading [my little zine](http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/email-newsletters-are-the-new-zines/)! Andâ€¦ onwards!

If you have a bit of time and want to know about the Millennium Falcon, [here is something for you](http://kitbashed.com/blog/a-complete-history-of-the-millennium-falcon).  
*Actually* it might be a good idea to take a day off and read through all of [Kitbashed](http://kitbashed.com/). Probably the best Star Wars page out there.

I have [mentioned](http://irregularity.co/44-post-cool-normcore/) before that I use Spotify's [Discover Weekly](http://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/) playlist on random as one of my three alarms.[^alarms]  
I hardly ever use their "Fresh Finds" playlists, though, but apparently they are pretty good, too. And [fuelled by *an army of hipsters*](http://qz.com/628812/spotify-is-using-an-anonymous-army-of-50000-hipsters-to-find-hot-new-songs/). Probably they are better at the whole music thing than the [Army of Lovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Lovers).

[^alarms]: And yes, I am a three alarms person. I am also a snooze person and a person who likes to sleep. Because sleep - that's where I'm a viking.

Remember [last week](http://irregularity.co/53-leap/)'s [cyborg rats](http://qz.com/618871/watch-a-cyborg-rat-could-point-the-way-to-a-post-ai-future/)? *Turns out* they might be our own future when it comes to [navigating the increasingly complex transit systems](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/most-public-transit-systems-are-too-big-for-humans-to-comprehend) out there.  
Most people I know use Google Maps or some other transit app for those by now, so we're already halfway there.

We have all seen [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogji3nSvPjg)/gif[^gif] of some dude with VR goggles while a young lady looks disinterested into the camera. We all had a bit of a giggle and moved one. *Turns out* the young lady - Eva Hoerth - is a VR researcher and was [pretty surprised by suddenly becoming a meme](https://medium.com/@downtohoerth/i-love-vr-but-hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-think-i-hate-it-5a3e803ea3e0). She also seems to be smart and funny, so that's an entertaining article to read.

[^gif]: Isn't it all the same these days?

New section alert!

***One Year Follow-Up[^name]***

[^name]: I'll rename this.

Last year [around this time](http://irregularity.co/1-llama/), we were all thinking about the colors of a dress. While we all just rolled our eyes and forgot about it again, [actual scientists kept thinking about it](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/03/the_science_of_the_black_and_blue_dress_one_year_later.single.html).

Be safe out there.
