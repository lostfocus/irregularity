Hello internet friends,

every week when writing these emails I sift through all the links I have collected in the previous couple of days, trying to find some things to amuse and/or enlighten you. Given that I am writing this email in English, most of my sources tend to be in the US and oh boy, have those been depressing lately.  
Maybe it is time we send a UN peacekeeping mission there until they stop (not so randomly) killing each other?  
Onwards.

Maybe for a laugh imagine being [the person who saw Bigfoot](http://www.outsideonline.com/2095096/man-who-created-bigfoot)?  
And now let's wonder [what happened back in 1908 in Siberia](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160706-in-siberia-in-1908-a-huge-explosion-came-out-of-nowhere).

If you have a lot of time and a lot of interest in China and the literature of China, learn something about the [ultra-unreality of modern China](http://lithub.com/modern-china-is-so-crazy-it-needs-a-new-literary-genre/).

Apparently a lot of oil tankers are idling around near big harbors, just sitting there, waiting. [What are they waiting for?](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160628-why-are-more-and-more-oil-ships-anchoring-off-singapore) It is more or less the same reason why some ships rather go [around the whole of Africa](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160303-cheap-oil-is-taking-shipping-routes-back-to-the-1800s) instead of crossing the Suez Canal.

Big sports events are what the internet likes to call a dumpster fire. Don't believe me? Well, have a look at [what the IOC wanted from Norway](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/02/ioc_demands_oslo_drops_bid_after_over_the_top_list_of_requirements.html) in case they'd run their winter games there.

Fast-forward selecta! [How Flight of the Conchords outlasted the hipster](http://theweek.com/articles/633486/how-flight-conchords-outlasted-hipster) - *turns out* mostly by being really *really* good at what they do.

Toodles!
