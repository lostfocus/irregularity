Hello internet friends!

Are you all watching the sports thing in Brazil? Yeah, me neither. But I do like the fact that it gives us great internet things, like [this analysis of gymnast Simone Biles' signature move.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/05/sports/olympics-gymnast-simone-biles.html)  
Pretty, pretty impressive.

While we silly humans amuse ourselves with these kind of games, our fellow primates are slowly plotting our demise. First [they get our secret documents](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/350775), then [they'll cook us](http://www.maxanimal.com/bonobo-starts-fire-and-cooks/).  
This is not going to end well.

One of the many overly nerdy things I enjoy - and I'm not talking about the ~cool~ nerdy things, like crushing it and writing [JavaScript apps](https://medium.com/friendship-dot-js/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558) - is public transport. So obviously a story of [a new "bus" which drives above other cars](http://shanghaiist.com/2016/08/02/straddling_bus_launch.php) is absolutely fascinating to me. Just look at that thing. It's supposed to run on rails, so it is both not a bus and probably won't scale very well.

So, apparently *the internet* decided that [we don't like cargo shorts](http://www.wsj.com/articles/nice-cargo-shorts-youre-sleeping-on-the-sofa-1470082856) anymore. Which is obviously crazy, where else would we store our cargo in summer?  
If this topic is [too controversial](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/761669158320812032) for you, maybe [this will take your mind of it](https://twitter.com/DannyPage/status/761645252251910144).

[I have been saying it](http://irregularity.co/35-machete-order/) for a while: [maybe we don't meet aliens because we're on one of the first planets to develop far enough](http://gizmodo.com/one-of-the-best-explanations-why-we-havent-found-alien-1784721423). 

Let's talk about our favourite caf√©s. You know the one - exposed walls with a couple of prints, tables made out of reclaimed wood, that italian-style coffee maker - but what you really should order is the cold brew. *Turns out* [these things are everywhere and they look the same all over the world](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification).

Before I let you go out there and have a productive week (:face_with_rolling_eyes:) let's do some housekeeping. Every week I tend to have more links than I want to put into these emails. They now have [a place on the internet](https://surplus.buzz/) and usually appear there a couple of hours after you get this email. It's an experiment and it's on medium dot com, so I think you can subscribe to it, somehow. Hm. It has an RSS feed as well, so maybe that's what you like better.

Toodles!
