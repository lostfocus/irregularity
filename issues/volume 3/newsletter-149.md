Hello internet friends,

because bots are *so hot right now* I wanted to open this email with one of those fake text message conversation pictures that some people use to amuse themselves.  
*Turns out* every single generator for those things is sleazy <abbr title="as fuck">af</abbr> and wants me to like/share/log into it with Facebook. So… not today.

Onwards! Bots! [Facebook Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) has them now, Microsoft has a [whole framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) for them and of course they are old news for people like me who actually use [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots).  
But are bots actually good at everything? Well, not necessarily. Maybe they are not the best UI paradigm (yeah!) if it takes [73 taps instead of 16 when ordering a pizza](http://dangrover.com/blog/2016/04/20/bots-wont-replace-apps.html).  
For what it's worth, I mostly don't want  to have media and commerce where I have conversations with my friends. Now that's a problem that no clever API can solve for media and commerce companies, isn't it?

I have no clever segue, so here's an article about publishing articles on the web in 2016: [Don’t Trust Your CMS](http://nymag.com/following/2016/04/dont-trust-your-cms.html).  
Even if you're not reading that article, take the title as an important bit of advice. (That being said, if you're even remotely interested in putting words (or other *content*, ehm) on the web - and I figure most of you are or you wouldn't still be reading this - it is worth reading. And give that I write stuff like this email in a text editor and then happily copy it into different CMSses the whole thing should be a proper warning to me, too.)

So, apparently [the new Beyoncé album is *really* good](http://mic.com/articles/141659/with-lemonade-beyonc-has-already-secured-2016-8217-s-album-of-the-year) but I'll sure as hell not pay for Tidal to listen to it.  

Heard that thing about the jet in the UK that hit a drone? Yeah, well. [That's more American Beauty than a drone.](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/drone-that-hit-british-airways-jet-was-likely-a-plastic-bag/)

Talking about the UK - what a bunch of [humorless tossers](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/04/18/britain-wont-name-ship-boaty-mcboatface-name-after-poll/83187578/). (I bet they'd love hearing that from a German person.)

I am a big fan of ramen - both the "good" kind and the instant one. And learning about the existence of the [World Instant Noodles Association ](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/meet-the-association-upholding-the-integrity-of-instant-noodles) gave me great pleasure.

Now let's learn more things!  
[Baby dinosaurs were not cute.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6284/450) (Except the little carnivores, who probably looked like [this](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/PAFF_0711_cutechick_chicks_article.jpg). Or more like [this](http://www.nbfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ChickWithEgg_Dollar62115459.jpg).)  
Planes used to [drop out of the sky in Iceland](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/icelands-ghost-fleet) a lot, back in the days. And thanks to Justin Bieber that's still a problem today.  
It still takes [a *lot* of work and ressources to produce a show for TV](http://fusion.net/story/293784/9-things-i-learned-about-tv-by-making-a-tv-show/). At least if you want to make it right.

This one I mostly like for the title: [Dolphins Are Helping Us Hunt for Aliens](http://nautil.us/blog/dolphins-are-helping-us-hunt-for-aliens). It's a bit misleading, though - they are mostly supposed to help us how to learn to communicate with beings that have a different way of expressing themselves than us. (Maybe we can use chatbots?)

I'm still not done! So much *content* to *curate* for you!  
I never really cared about Indycar, but I'm a sucker for articles about the history of car racing. [This one is pretty fascinating](http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a28594/vintage-indy-500-race-cars/).

Phew. Now we're done. You have a week to catch up - or at least to instapaper all the great links and feel bad about not reading them.  
Have fun.
