Hello internet friends,

first things first: happy [Year of the Fire Rooster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_(zodiac))!  
Onwards!

On Friday the dumpster fire on the other side of the Atlantic has escalated even more. The Verge is looking at [how the CEOs auf Silicon Valley companies are responding](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14426550/silicon-valley-trump-immigration-response). Meanwhile this is [how things look like from the Middle East](https://skift.com/2017/01/28/what-trumps-muslim-visa-ban-looks-like-from-the-middle-east/). At least the reaction of the American public is somewhat encouraging with protests all over the country and [a record sum of donations](http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/aclu-immigration-ban-donald-trump-fundraising/) to the [ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union).  
<abbr title="I don't know">idk</abbr> people, all of this really scares me and I doubt that things will get any better soon.

Well, let's forget about the future that will be for a while and remember the future that could have been. It's always weirdly soothing to look at [drawings by Syd Mead](https://www.drivetribe.com/p/X8VfQUfeQBWdJVT_c1Ce2g/dzB6sIhJTkCJ9o4SiJS5Fg).

Another way to calm our nerves might be reading the works of one of the many self-help gurus out there. *Turns out* - and this is the real surprise here - these people are usually [not what they seem to be](http://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/1/23/14238530/self-help-advice-bogus).

We all liked Jurassic Park, right? Well, just imagine how adorable (and probably even more terrifying) it would have been with [huge otters](https://qz.com/893494/scientists-discovered-a-110-pound-otter-that-lived-6-2-million-years-ago-in-china/). I mean - huge otters are scarier than huge chicken, right?

One of those cheesy authors that keeps getting reposted into my Tumblr dashboard once said we're all made of stardust. :unamused:  
But do you want to know what is really made of stardust? [The dirt and grime on our roofs.](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/no-urban-legend-our-rooftops-are-collecting-stardust/) *Turns out*, eh?

Stay safe out there. Stay sane.  
Toodles!
