Hello internet friends!

I'm not so sure what to think about this whole deal with [the Panama papers](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/), yet. A lot of journalists seem to be pretty psyched by their own work, which actually is pretty impressive, so: good for them.  
I have my doubts that this won't be out of the news cycle pretty soon, though - there is always stuff happening and most people have short attention spans.

Talking about short attention spans: [Chipmunks!](http://www.avclub.com/article/slowed-down-chipmunks-are-both-brilliant-and-terri-227794)

You might want to have [a good laugh at Juicero](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11337444/juicero-wifi-connected-smart-juicer-is-ridiculous),  the Nespresso of juices, but then remember: they managed to [get themselves $70m](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/31/investors-pour-70-million-into-juicero-a-smart-kitchen-appliance-maker/) and articles not only in the tech press, but also [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/business/juicero-juice-system-silicon-valley-interest.html?nytmobile=0&_r=0) and [Vogue](http://www.vogue.com/13421774/juicero-cold-pressed-juice-home-juicer-no-mess/).  
But hey, it is ~[Food Tech](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/01/food-technology-soylent-slimfast-juice-fasting)~

Talking about collecting a lot of investment for something ridiculous and/or non-working: [Electronic Gills](http://nerdist.com/people-have-spent-nearly-1-million-on-bunk-electronic-gills/)!  
Unlike the juicer this might kill somebody, so it's not quite as funny. On the other hand, that articles from the New York Times mentions some dangers of the ~smart juicer~:

> Working with freelance welders and machinists, he built prototypes in his Brooklyn kitchen. By 2013, he had a working model, albeit one that occasionally blew apart, sending pieces of metal and food scraps flying across the room.

Boom.

Have you taken [a selfie of a hoverboard](http://www.theawl.com/2016/03/arent-you-all-ashamed-of-yourselves) lately?  
Words have meanings. The *only* smart person in [the whole Egyptair story](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/british-passenger-took-a-cheeky-picture-with-the-egyptair-hijack/) mentions that, too. It's an exercise for the reader to find out who she is.
