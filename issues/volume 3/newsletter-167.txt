Hello internet friends,

how about starting the week with something rather lovely? Then here we go, a long love letter to the [scientifically out-dated but still rather amazing dinosaurs model at Crystal Palace in London](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/the-dinosaurs-of-crystal-palace-among-the-most-accurate-renditions-of-prehistoric-life-ever-made/).  
That's quite a story. A slightly more modern take on these animals - if probably just as untrue - is by t[his Australian company, which tries to recreate dinosaurs as real-sized animatronic models](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-25/australia-s-dinosaur-laboratory). Now where are the feathers?

*They* say that one should avoid the kinds of restaurants that have a menu with pictures - a piece of advice that I have found to be completely silly, as these things go. I wonder (actually, I don't) what *they* will say about [a menu written completely in Emoji](http://www.eater.com/2016/8/22/12562016/emoji-menus-restaurants).

*Kids these days* don't really want to read their tech news anymore. (Get off my lawnâ€¦ ðŸ‘´) So obviously they get it from the one place where they find *everything* - YouTube. And t[his guy is the number one Tech-YouTuber out there.](https://theringer.com/the-kid-who-revolutionized-youtubes-tech-reviews-a5b9a2a03a04)

Remember CDs? If you're Japanese, you probably look at your stack of rented CDs, shake your head and think ["Remember?"](http://qz.com/711490/why-japan-has-more-music-stores-than-the-rest-of-the-world/)

A very different way to get digital content happens in Cuba, where the Internet is a very scarce good. They call it [El Paquete](http://www.vox.com/2015/9/21/9352095/netflix-cuba-paquete-internet) and it is very fascinating, indeed.

Only in Russia: [Moscow airport gets Kalashnikov souvenir shop](http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2016/08/22/sale-moscows-airport-model-ak-47-assault-rifles/89091916/)

Meanwhile in Singapore: [The worldâ€™s first network of fully self-driving taxis is up and running](http://www.recode.net/2016/8/25/12639472/nutonomy-self-driving-taxis-singapore). I wonder if it's possible to get these things to drive slow enough to breed some Pokemon Go eggs - which might be just the thing to get[ the country that's obsessed with that game](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-police-patrols-in-pokemon-go-hot-spot) to adopt self-driving cars for real.

Toodles!
