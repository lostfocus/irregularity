Hello internet friends,

so many things we have learned about technology last week.  
I personally had to learn that emoji might not work as email subject line. Oh well.  

Mostly we had to learn that it takes about one day for the internet [to ruin everything](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist). At least we got this headline out of it: [Microsoft deletes 'teen girl' AI after it became a Hitler-loving sex robot within 24 hours](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/24/microsofts-teen-girl-ai-turns-into-a-hitler-loving-sex-robot-wit/)  

But of course we can learn so much from it! We can learn that [Microsoft has been running a bot like this](http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/) in China for quite some while which did somehow *not* become a nazi sex bot. (I saw Nazi Sex Bot in a small underground club before they broke into the mainstream and called themselves Tokio Hotel.)  
Then there are the smart people who have been doing internet-facing bots for a while, they have some reckons, too. For a good primer on text bots and how Microsoft made the most basic mistake with their Tay, look no further than [this introductory article by Ben Brown](https://blog.howdy.ai/tay-what-155c8ef603e9). And then there's Motherboard's Sarah Jeong with [How to Make a Bot That Isn't Racist](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-to-make-a-not-racist-bot).  
Well, good to know. [*My* bot](https://twitter.com/botminik) - and you knew I had to had one at some point - is just [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) running with my tweets. So its baseline for terribleness is me, which of course might already be a problem.

More automated bot things!  
[Watch an automated deer run around GTA.](http://sanandreasanimalcams.com/) And yes, [people will have to learn how to drive self-driving cars.](http://recode.net/2016/03/25/self-driving-cars-safety/)

Other stuff!  
Wired has [a big feature on the comedians in Silicon Valley](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/silicon-valley-new-comedy-economy/) and how the comedy business works these days.  
And [The Guardian has the best argument in favour of cash](http://www.theguardian.com/money/commentisfree/2016/mar/21/fear-cashless-world-contactless).

Be safe out there, have a good week.
