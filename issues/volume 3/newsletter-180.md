Hello internet friends,

you might remember that [stunning timelapse of Singapore](https://vimeo.com/169993072) which I linked to [in June](http://irregularity.co/15-free-booze/). Insider TV has [a nice little video portrait of Keith Loutit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxd3YcHu-UI), the photographer who shot that timelapse.

Back in the year 2000 (am I the only one who immediately has that Silverchair song playing in their head when someone mentions "in the year 2000"?) I actually was one of the few-ish people who went to the ill-fated [Expo 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_2000) world's fair. There is now [a new book by Jade Doskow](http://blackdogonline.com/photography/lost-utopias.html) who travelled the sites of past world's fairs to look at what's left of them. [Atlas Obscura has a few of her photos](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/photographing-the-lost-utopias-of-the-remaining-worlds-fairs).

I really have no idea how books happen. Somehow they just manifest themselves in a library or bookstore, to be enjoyed by readers. Just like milk comes from a box and electricity just appears in my walls. At least the first of those mysteries is now solved by *internet friend* Sarah Cooper, who is in the process of turning her blog post [10 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings](http://thecooperreview.com/10-tricks-appear-smart-meetings/) into [a book with 10x more tricks](http://www.100tricks.com/) and was kind enough to give us [a behind the scenes look](http://thecooperreview.com/how-to-turn-a-blog-post-into-a-book-deal-in-12-months/).

In the late 90s a lot of people boxed air while being yelled at. *Turns out* Billy Blanks is still around and [still doing his Tae Bo thing](http://www.racked.com/2016/9/15/12907572/tae-bo-billy-blanks). Pretty fascinating dude.

Ants are very prolific farmers. How prolific, you ask? Well, [they pick the aphids](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/ants-are-destroying-your-plants-by-nurturing-perfect-aphid-colonies/) they use for their honeydew farming in a way that ensures the optimal ressource extraction from each plant.

Toodles!
