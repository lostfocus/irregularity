Hello internet friends,

first email of the year! Yay.  
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯[^ssdy]

[^ssdy]: Or as we say in the business: Eh. Same Shit, Different Year. Don't ask in what kind of business. 

Now for some Star Wars. Because obviously.  
[Why Carrie Fisher Should Be Remembered As General Organa, Not Princess Leia](https://www.bustle.com/p/why-carrie-fisher-should-be-remembered-as-general-organa-not-princess-leia-26490) - very much so. I mean - both, but still. She was the best part of The Force Awakens and given that I quite liked that movie, that's something. (She also was by far the best part of "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" - but we better forget about that movie pretty quick.)

A wonderful piece of fan fiction is this [obituary to General Organa](https://mobunited.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/leia-organa-a-critical-obituary/). It's so well written and so obviously by a nerdy fan without being too… well, nerdy-fan-y. 

While much has been said about the Star Wars costume designer's [love for multiple pens](https://twitter.com/faitherina/status/811689755796717568) one thing is pretty amazing: We don't see many written words in these movies. [Most Citizens of the Star Wars Galaxy are Probably Totally Illiterate](http://www.tor.com/2012/10/03/most-citizens-of-the-star-wars-galaxy-are-probably-totally-illiterate/). So maybe these are not pens but [terrible USB sticks](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-disk-formats-of-star-wars-rogue-one-spoilers) or something?

Robot news!  
I've been sternly warned that enough is enough with the robot sex articles. So: none of those this week. (That is pretty easy, though. I didn't even see one anywhere.)  
What else do we have, then? There's this overview of companies that work on [robots that take us places](http://www.recode.net/2016/12/29/14102028/self-driving-startups-2017). And there is this [robot that takes care of your child](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/five-elements-robotics-announces-the-launch-of-5e-nannybot-the-robot-that-watches-your-children-300383570.html).  
Robots *are* going to take our jobs. But [do they want to](http://digg.com/2016/the-robots-want-your-job)?[^capitalism]  
Either way, robots and AIs are going to be in the future a lot. And here we have [one company that is *really* happy about it](http://qz.com/870658/in-the-race-to-build-the-best-ai-theres-already-one-clear-winner/).

*Turns out* [bats are a lot like us](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-translate-bat-talk-and-they-argue-lot-180961564/). Just, you know, better.

Toodles!

[^capitalism]: As usual with these "robots are going to take our jobs" articles: the real problems aren't the robots. The real problem is capitalism.
