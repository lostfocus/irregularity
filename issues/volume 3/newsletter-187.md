Hello internet friends,

this comes a bit later than usual, but it took a long sleep, a lot of soup and a coffee to keep both a cold and the demon dogs at bay.  
Let's get to it, then.

Another clear sign we are in fact living in a cyberpunk future is that we now have people who can [fly a drone around to take control of lightbulbs](https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/03/hackers-hijack-a-philips-hue-lights-with-a-drone/). This is both slightly terrifying and slightly amazing. (Unrelated sidenote: does anyone need some used Hue lights?)

If you aren't watching [Westworld](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/), yet, you do miss out on some quality TV. (Which is something that can be said about *so* much these days. I say it about Westworld because that's what I'm watching right now. I'm probably not watching so many other great series, but, you know… ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ) Anyway, a good way to measure a series' cultural impact is to look at the quality of [fan fiction](https://theringer.com/i-spent-5-3-million-at-westworld-ama-a25178daa4b9) that appears around it.

First they came for our headphone jacks and I didn't speak up, because meh. Then they came for our other ports and I only grumbled a bit, because first world problem. But [what Apple is doing now is too much](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/emojis-are-becoming-hyper-realistic-and-that-is-a-bad-thing).  

Warning! If you don't like tentacled monsters from the deep, don't follow the next link. If you do, have a look into [the weird ways Humboldt squids communicate](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150121-humboldt-jumbo-squid-crittercam-animal-ocean-science/).

Toodles.
