Hello internet friends,

I'm a bit worried that at this point in time this email turns into a "look, history!" newsletter, but what can I do, there's cool new stuff around. Like this week's announcement that those Australians who shot lasers at the Cambodian countryside actually did find something - and not just any old random kind of something but [a whole huge city all around Angkor Wat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/lost-city-medieval-discovered-hidden-beneath-cambodian-jungle).  
Isn't that pretty fascinating? I think it is.

I've never been to San Francisco, but based on my knowledge of the tech scene over here and what I gather from Twitter and ~the internet~ in general, I have pretty much decided that the TV show "Silicon Valley" is not as much a satire as non-tech people might think and more of a documentary.  
*Turns out* [I'm pretty much right](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-silicon-valley-nails-silicon-valley).

You don't believe me? Well, [this is how the Recode conference is in ~real life.~](https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/ground-control-to-silicon-valley)  
"The free booze helped." Oh. Okay.

At some point this weekend I saw this gem of a video: [The Lion City II - Majulah](https://vimeo.com/169993072). Probably the best timelapse there is at the moment.  
My favourite scene in it is the single car swerving through Singapore's highrises until finally getting to its parking spot.

Toodles!
