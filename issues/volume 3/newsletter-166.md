Hello internet friends,

not many things from the 90s are still pretty cool - one of the few exceptions is the Super Soaker. [Learn a bit about the nerd who invented those things.](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37062579)

I am absolutely fascinated by the ["Lost Cities" series over at The Guardian.](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/lost-cities)  
Some I already knew about -[Babylon](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/08/lost-cities-1-babylon-iraq-war-history-mankind-greatest-heritage-site),  [Troy](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/09/lost-cities-2-search-real-troy-hisarlik-turkey-mythology-homer-iliad), obviously, because I did read the Illiad and more than one Schliemann biography, [Pompeii](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/11/lost-cities-4-pompeii-roman-preserved-disaster-vesuvius-volcano-second-extinction) and the [Angkor megacity](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/16/lost-cities-6-angkor-wat-nasa-technology-khmer-megacity) that we discussed [before](http://irregularity.co/15-free-booze/). And all the others are just as interesting.  
Have you heard of [Cahokia](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/17/lost-cities-8-mystery-ahokia-illinois-mississippians-native-americans-vanish) before?

I like me some geotags and GPS coordinates and maps and such things. So do millions of gadgets worldwide - from mobile phones and cameras to drones and autonomous farming equipment. *Turns out* that [plate tectonics are now a factor on how well these things work](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/plate-tectonics-gps-navigation).

I can't really remember how many bad fantasy novels I read in my lifetime - but I do know that quite often the maps were a lot more interesting than yet another hero's journey. Now I can have the maps without the stories - on Twitter. [This bot tweets a new fantasy map every hour.](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/bot-tweets-totally-fantastical-map-every-hour/)  
It is really lovely. And if you want to know how it's done - [here you go.](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/)

The nice thing about fantasy maps is the fact that they are, well, fantasy and don't have to show the messy side of geography. [Unlike Google maps.](https://medium.com/@mbogen/is-google-wired-for-geopolitics-77ae9a2d7fa2)

Toodles!
