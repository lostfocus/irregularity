Hello internet friends,

good news! [More Tasmanian Devils found!](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/clones-no-more-as-a-secret-population-of-tasmanian-devils-discovered-20160524-gp2fy9.html)  
I mean, I don't have any attachment to these critters and such, but all things considered, that sounds like good news to me.  

So, my burning veins cry in eternity. Apparently [the most metal sentence in the world](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2016/Apr/20/heavy-metal-and-natural-language-processing-part-1/). It is indeed very good to know which words are the most metal and which ones aren't.

It is very important to have hobbies. Maybe "finding the ugly naked guy from Friends" might be a semi-questionable one. [But hey, success!](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ugly-naked-guy-friends_us_573caa4ae4b0ef86171cef1f)

This is super interesting: [Multi Entry](http://www.multientry.com/) - "A decentralized collection of stories and media about the creative young people of modern mainland China and the culture they're creating."  
And it has GIFs, too.

I leave it as an exercise to you to connect the dots in these three articles. If you're not particularly interested in ~the web~ there's a hint in the last paragraph of the Williams portrait.

* [The Forrest Gump of the Internet ](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/ev-williams-is-the-forrest-gump-of-the-internet/486899/)
* [The Moral Economy of Tech](http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm)
* [Farm to keyboard: why software is the next “craft” industry](http://qz.com/715291/farm-to-keyboard-why-software-is-the-next-craft-industry/)

It's still Monday morning, but I'd already be okay with a drink.

Toodles.
