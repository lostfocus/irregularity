Hello internet friends,

for years I thought the most dangerous thing that could drop on my head could be some bird poo. Or maybe a random asteroid that will end all but the most resilient life, but I don't think we'll be *that* lucky in our lifetime.  
[*Turns out* crocodiles climb trees](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/crocodiles-can-climb-trees/), too. (See, the *turns out* is even in their headline!) I haven't heard any actual facts in the way of crocodiles living here in the middle of Europe, but you never know.

The rise of ~YouTube stars~ was the first thing that ever made me feel old. But I think I've finally come around, because whatever it is [this young woman](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-is-not-an-interview-with-poppy) is doing is very much my kind of humor.  
Meanwhile in the department of "things are different in China" - [live-streaming seems to be *really* big there](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/chinas-live-streaming-factory). But eh, probably they're not that different. There's the whole Twitch thing and… eh… whatever else is doing the live-streaming these days. How would I know? In internet years I'm old. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Here, a public service from Irregularity HQ: I have learned that some of my readers don't quite know what these things are, what the difference is and that they have it - so I managed to find an article that explains them pretty nicely: [How to Tell Whether You've Got Angst, Ennui, or Weltschmerz](http://mentalfloss.com/article/58230/how-tell-whether-youve-got-angst-ennui-or-weltschmerz)

I forgot all three of those for a short time while reading [this wonderful article on Soylent](http://reallifemag.com/liquid-lunch/). The pull quotes alone are worth clicking that link, he says, staring off into the distance.  
Meanwhile people who actually produce real food have a whole other problem: [their equipment is increasingly locked behind DRM](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-right-to-repair-movement-is-being-led-by-farmers).

Toodles!
