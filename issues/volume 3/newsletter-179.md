Hello internet friends,

want to mess up your brain on a monday morning? Sure, then look at [this optical illusion](https://twitter.com/wkerslake/status/775105333333204992).  
I didn't have my coffee, yet, and that thing makes me so dizzy.

As far as I can tell, the Pok√©mon Go craze has mostly calmed down. Which is lucky, after all it is [the world's most dangerous game](http://www.vice.com/read/pokemon-go-moral-panics-satanism-infosec).

Did you do the blow? Nono, now *that* one. And not *that* one, either. The one that scared away the evil dust spirits from the game cartridges. [The intersection of technology and superstition is a fun one.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-we-still-practice-superstitious-rituals-with-our-technology)

One way for local governments to save some money on road repairs? [Make sure those roads follow a smuggling route.](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/traffickers-repair-russian-road-used-for-smuggling-55065)

Something I have wondered for quite some while: [Why Are Babies So Dumb If Humans Are So Smart?](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-are-babies-so-dumb-if-humans-are-so-smart)  
Once you get past the clickbait-y, but in a smart way, headline, this is actually a good article on evolution and, well, babies.

The Millennial to Snake Person browser plugin [delivers once again](http://fusion.net/story/342418/millennial-newsletter-soap-is-dead/). (And again I had to disable it to send this email.)

[Clown sightings have spread to North Carolina. Now police are concerned about creepy copycats.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/07/clown-sightings-have-spread-to-north-carolina-now-police-are-concerned-about-creepy-copycats/) Something something viral marketing, am I right? I'd still freak out if I saw a clown standing around somewhere. Luckily I just never leave the house, so that's out of the question.  
Except when I accidentally put on my clown makeup when sleepwalking again.

That feeling when you [don't know why your rocket exploded](http://www.recode.net/2016/9/9/12863856/elon-musk-space-x-explosion-what-happened).

We used to have more poultry news here in these emails. (And by we I don't mean the royal or even the editorial we. I am talking about me and you.) So I am pretty glad to have this for you: [A Reading from the Book of Poultry](http://blogs.harvard.edu/preserving/2016/09/09/a-reading-from-the-book-of-poultry/)  
Wow, these are some magnificent birds.

Here, if you don't know how to cook, [this might be helping](http://distractify.com/food/2016/09/01/basic-cookbook-ftw).

Toodles!
