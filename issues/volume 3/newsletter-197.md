Hello internet friends,

as so many of us I quite enjoy the idea of a shower beer. I mean, this brewer here even created [a beer that is specifically made for shower consumption](https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/theres-finally-a-beer-made-specifically-for-drinking-in-the-shower).  
But after some serious experimentation I realised that this is yet another thing where I like the idea of something a lot more than the actual experience. I'm probably a slow drinker, so beer is getting luke-warm for me even in normal conditions. But in a hot shower? How's that supposed to work?  
Onwards.

Remember that alien megastructure that wasn't a megastructure at all but [we don't quite know what it is](http://irregularity.co/34-ubergangsjacke/)? *Turns out* it might actually be [a star eating a planet](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2117459-alien-megastructure-signal-may-be-due-to-star-eating-a-planet/)!  
This is all pretty exciting stuff. Would you like to [know more](http://www.wherestheflux.com/)?

It's not all stars and planets up there in space. There is also a *lot* of space junk that we humans left there. And sometimes that stuff falls back to earth and somehow survives that fall. And that's what [amateur space debris enthusiasts](http://www.eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/space-debris/) are looking for.

CES seems to be a weird, weird place to visit while being sober. I'd rather not imagine what it would be like on LSD. Luckily I don't have to imagine, because [that's how it is](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/08/i-dropped-acid-and-saw-into-the-future-my-surreal-first-time-at-ces.html).

Toodles!
