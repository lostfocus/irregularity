Hello internet friends,

aren't we all excited about a new week, [lol](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/how-lol-became-a-punctuation-mark/472824/).  
Onwards. Or maybe not quite, yet. After all it is monday, so just for getting up and starting the week, we should get a little reward. And here it is - [New Order's Blue Monday, played on instruments from the 1930s.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03lh9lt)

I still didn't manage to watch the new Deadpool movie but I already managed to read this think piece: [Why Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine is Actually Way Better Than The 2016 Deadpool](http://www.dorkly.com/post/77488/why-deadpool-in-x-men-origins-wolverine-is-actually-way-better-than-the-2016-deadpool)

A few weeks back a group of *~artists~* claimed they had smuggled Microsoft Kinect scanners into the Neue Museum in Berlin and used them to make a very high resolution 3D scarn of the Nefertiti bust. *Turns out* not so much - it is way more likely that [a copy of the museum's own scan data found its way to them](http://thegreatfredini.com/2016/03/06/theres-something-fishy-about-the-other-nefertiti/).  
This is quite something.

"If I look even more tired than usual, it might be [this man's fault.](http://www.polygon.com/features/2016/3/4/11158134/the-man-who-made-a-million-empires)"  
He said, like addicts do when they blame the drug producers instead of facing their own weak will.

New section alert!

***Interesting links for which I couldn't think of a little paragraph so I just dump them on you in the hope that you still find them as interesting as I did***

[The Myth of the Barter Economy](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/barter-society-myth/471051/) - Adam Smith said that quid-pro-quo exchange systems preceded economies based on currency, but there’s no evidence that he was right.

[The roots of Tim Cook’s activism lie in rural Alabama](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/07/in-rural-alabama-the-activist-roots-of-apples-tim-cook/)

[Why Nobody Can Build an Email Killer](http://nymag.com/following/2016/03/why-nobody-can-build-an-email-killer.html)

You are welcome.

***Looking back one year and trying to figure out what happened since then***

I said the name of that section would change, didn't I? Well, here you go. Do they have courses on naming things better?

[Last year around this time](http://irregularity.co/2-buy-buy-buy/) we were thinking about how [our attention is being monetized](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/the-cost-of-paying-attention.html) and oh boy, did nothing change.  
It is a big war on *the web* though - on the one hand, we have publishers, who [fight ad-blocking in every way they can](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/advertisers-plan-to-stop-ad-blocking) and on the other hand we have the first browser vendor who ships a (preview) version of their main product with [ad-blocking built in](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3042172/browsers/operas-testing-a-browser-that-kills-ads-accelerating-webpage-loading-by-up-to-90-percent.html).

Be safe, everybody. And maybe don't [go viral](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a42901/viral-twice-online/) for the wrong reasons.
