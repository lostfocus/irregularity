Hello internet friends,

another Monday, this one with me cranky and slightly feverish in bed. Soâ€¦ let's see how that will work for us.

Smart cities! They'll probably work about as good as smart homes, which probably means - not all that good. Because what we should not forget - [a city is not a computer.](https://placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/) (Well, unless we get rid of all these pesky humans and just replace them with little robots.)

One thing that will always be a ~bug~ in a city will be the creative ways some of us humans are just a tiny little bit smarter than the systems around us. Take for example [these models](http://www.gq.com/story/green-angels-weed-delivery-models-new-york) who use their ~being models~ skills to distribute weed in New York.

But sometimes we make little mistakes, no matter how smart we are. Just look at these friendly fellas, who [accidentally bought a giant pig](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/experience-i-accidentally-bought-a-giant-pig).

Now, shall we play "internet entrepreneurs being internet entrepreneurs" first or maybe a bit of science first?  
Well, let's do science! *Turns out* it [is possible to measure the historical state of Earth's magnetic field by looking at old clay jars](http://www.popsci.com/ancient-jars-hold-clues-about-intensity-earths-magnetic-field). That's *pretty* amazing. 

So, internet entrepreneurs! Partying, [throwing bread around](http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-fling-social-media-app-died-2016-11) - awesome! (I still like the clay pots more. Or maybe the models who sell pot? I can't decide.)

Toodles!
