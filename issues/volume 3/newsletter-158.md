Hello internet friends,

I know, I know. It's Tuesday. Life happens. Here we go anyway, let's do it.

I do have a metric (hah!) buttload of Brexit articles in my Instapaper but I am pretty sure we're all slightly sick of hearing about it at the moment, aren't we? So in the spirit of escapism, why don't we  take a breath (you know, without our bloody watch telling us to do it) and watch a bunch of [capybara videos on the YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeR0UpnpUxFZg-3-2UlzyaQ). I don't know about you but it calms me down considerably.

As a big proponent of the "more selfies!" movement - which I might have just invented, who knows? - I am obviously pretty much in favour of all the angry tweets (are there any others these days? I am not too sure anymore.) triggered by [this New York Times article.](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/is-selfie-culture-making-our-kids-selfish/)  
A [few](https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/747469179897413632) [personal](https://twitter.com/PAYOLETTER/status/747470360694693888) [favorites](https://twitter.com/meakoopa/status/747509195755294722).

So, capybaras and selfies, are we all nice and calm now? Well, depending on your personal disposition this [ode to gentrification](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/what-works-cincinnati-ohio-over-the-rhine-crime-neighborhood-turnaround-city-urban-revitalization-213969) might either make your head explode or maybe you just nod along. Either way, it is *interesting.*

If you have a lot of time on your hands and want to read something extremely disturbing how about this? [My four months as a private prison guard.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer)

I do enjoy magazines quite a lot, but somehow I never quite felt in the target demographic of either of them. But finally there is one [aimed directly at me.](http://www.metafilter.com/160408/Shouldnt-you-be-moisturizing-Megan-moisturizes)

That's it for today, let's go outside and warm ourselves on our own personal little [trash fire](https://medium.com/@monstro/all-human-systems-are-enormous-trash-fires-30b9de6fa603).

Toodles!
