Hello internet friends,

autumn is upon us, it is rainy, grey and cold where I am. (I write, conveniently ignoring the fact that it's going to be bloody warm again in a few days. 30°C in Mid-September? That's just silly.)  
So let's just take this opportunity, have a cup of coffee and see if we can learn something new.

Last week the *whole world* was pretty excited about [a phone call from space](http://observer.com/2016/08/not-a-drill-seti-is-investigating-a-possible-extraterrestrial-signal-from-deep-space/). *Turns out* (and this is in the actual headline) it was [just something boring](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/08/turns-out-the-signal-astronomers-saw-was-strong-because-it-came-from-earth/) here from our little planet.

All things considered, we should not be too surprised - after all, what would aliens actually want from us? Maybe [check on their pyramids](http://ironychan.tumblr.com/post/137070533675/this-is-the-great-pyramid-of-king-khufu)?

Running something big-ish on the internet is not easy and people get fed up with it. Here, I just saved you a click. But if you want more details: [Who Killed YTMND?](http://gizmodo.com/who-killed-ytmnd-1785765611)  
If you've never heard of YTMND, good for you. Keep on reading.

Remember [Socality Barbie](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/hipster-barbie)? The Instagram account that mocked basically *everything* on Social Media? Now there is real Barbie and sadly [nothing of it is satire](http://www.dailydot.com/irl/barbie-instagram-influencer/).

Burning Man. Where [Pokémon Go](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/burning-mans-supposed-to-be-off-the-gridunless-you-want-to-play-pokmon-go) and [Class Warfare](http://fortune.com/2016/09/04/burning-man-sabotage/) meet. What a slogan.

Toodles!
