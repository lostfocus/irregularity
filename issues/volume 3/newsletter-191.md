Hello internet friends,

do you have what it takes to be an Instagram influencer? Well, if not, [this article might have some ideas what you'll need](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-11-30/confessions-of-an-instagram-influencer). #inspirational

This morning I learned about [lights-out manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_out_(manufacturing)) which is pretty much what it sounds like - a process of running a factory without any humans - which would need light. So… lights out.  
(Having learned Latin in high school I cringe at the idea of calling *-facturing* without *manus* manufacturing, but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)  
I have learned this on a [MetaFilter post](http://www.metafilter.com/163643/Fck-Work) which linked to [this article on the future of what we used to call work](https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-jobs-are-not-the-solution-but-the-problem).  
idk, I guess if we can manage to get around that we can start to think more about [The Unbusy Manifesto](http://qz.com/845419/jonathan-fields-the-unbusy-manifesto-how-to-slow-down-chill-out-and-live-life-more-intentionally/).

One of the things that increasingly get automated is driving - and one of the companies that put in a lot of work to make trucks self-driving is Otto, a subsidiary of Uber. Uber is already not all that well-known for being extremely ethical so it might be quite interesting to learn how [Otto managed to "test" their trucks on public roads without proper paperwork](https://backchannel.com/how-otto-defied-nevada-and-scored-a-680-million-payout-from-uber-496aa07f5ba2).

Remember MakerBot? Somehow most people still don't have a handy little 3D printer at home and [if you want to know why, well - it's your lucky day.](https://backchannel.com/the-3d-printing-revolution-that-wasnt-60b000c3a3ed)

If there's proper public transport and good ramen, I don't think how anything would be wrong with [this idea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/swap-driving-licence-cheap-noodles-discount-japan-older-motorists). (Honestly, those are two important factors for a high quality of life anyway.)

Toodles!
