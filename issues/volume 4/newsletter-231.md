Hello internet friends,

had a rough Monday? Well, probably not as rough as the *poor, poor* clowns that are now getting bullied all over the world because somehow they're considered to be creepy these days: [Clowns Gearing Up To Protest ‘It’ Over Negative Clown Stereotypes](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/8xxz4x/clowns-gearing-up-to-protest-it-over-negative-clown-stereotypes)

**Faster, Pussybot, Kill! Kill!**

I try to stay away from sex bot content these days, because I got some sternly worded feedback a couple of months back - but maybe some of you need this warning? [Hackers could program sex robots to kill.](http://nypost.com/2017/09/11/hackers-could-program-sex-robots-to-kill/)

**Romanes Eunt Domus**

[Unearthed near Hadrian’s Wall: lost secrets of first Roman soldiers to fight the barbarians.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/hadrians-wall-lost-secrets-roman-vindolanda-unearthed) Not bad. I figure that far away in the future when civilization is rebuilt from whatever apocalypse we're heading into, they'll mostly find plastic bags and smartphones and will not have a very favourable opinion on us.  
Meanwhile they'll probably face the same problem when trying to figure out how our food tasted: most things will be exctinct. Just like this magical spice: [The mystery of the lost Roman herb](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170907-the-mystery-of-the-lost-roman-herb)

**Spiders!**

I'm not quite so sure how much I am in favour of scientists using science to make artificially enhanced spiders. Especially when they are enhanced in a way that their webs are now strong enough to catch humans. But I guess we'll find out how good of an idea that will be: [Spider Drinks Graphene, Spins A Web That Can Carry A Human](http://www.disclose.tv/news/spider_drinks_graphene_spins_a_web_that_can_carry_a_human/140186)

**Brands**

But maybe humanity is now just ripe to be overrun and eaten by spiders. [Finger-Lickin’ Lulz](https://thebaffler.com/latest/finger-lickin-lulz-cross) might be one of the many signs that our time should be over.

On that happy note: toodles!
