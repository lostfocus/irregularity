Hello internet friends,

things that I have seen last weekend: people's confused faces when the announcements in a Swiss train were made by a guy from Cologne with a very Cologne-y humor. A nun with AirPods. An Aston Martin DB5.  
Thanks, dear readers, for acting as my diary. I really appreciate it.

**Monkey Business**

No, this is not about the whole [macaque selfie thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute). It is about something a lot more enjoyable: the time before proper maps existed and explorers ran around the globe, trying to, well, explore the world. Weird stuff happened back then: for over a hundred years Europeans were just so convinced that a golden mountain range was sitting right in the middle of Africa. And while we know by now that this isn't quite the case, it is still a neat concept for an art project: [The Fake Mountain Range That Appeared on Maps for a Century](https://www.wired.com/story/the-fake-mountain-range-that-appeared-on-maps-for-a-century/)  

**Badger Badger**

I honestly don't know how to get from a story about colorful fantastical pictures to a story about an acid trip, but that might be because I never tried having one. So instead I just give you the title: [Back in 1982 I was dealing acid at Jim Morrison’s grave and that’s when I first met Vladimir Putin.](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/9/10/1697580/-Back-in-1982-I-was-selling-acid-at-Jim-Morrison-s-grave-that-s-when-I-first-met-Vladimir-Putin)  

**Self-help**

I'm pretty sure Quartz knows what a bunch of sad lonely people are their main target group. Why else would they run articles like [There’s an easy way to be funnier and more genuine without turning into a jerk](https://qz.com/950935/theres-an-easy-way-to-be-funnier-and-more-genuine-without-turning-into-a-jerk/) and [How do you make new friends as an adult? Be like the golden retriever](https://qz.com/887413/how-do-you-make-new-friends-as-an-adult-be-like-the-golden-retriever/)?  
I'll leave it as an exercise to you why I'm linking to them here. (I love you all, don't worry. (Well, actually I don't. I don't even know most of you.))

**Live From New York**

I love everything about this story: [Hold the Egg Sandwich:
Egyptian TV Is Calling](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/nyregion/hatem-el-gamasy-bodega-television-egypt-pundit.html) I think more TV stations around the world should use intelligent bodega owners as their foreign correspondents.  
(Unless some startup-bros replace them all with bloody vending machines, but I guess [that's not going to happen](https://www.eater.com/2017/9/13/16302386/bodega-startup-corner-store-silicon-valley).)

Toodles!

(Oh, wait, by the way - did you ever wonder [Why Your Favorite TV Character’s Dress Looks So Different on You](https://www.racked.com/2017/9/15/16227002/tv-clothes-dont-fit-tailor)? Me neither, but it is fascinating. And I've learned a great new word for the type of untucked shirt that the Apple executives seem to like: butt mullet.)
