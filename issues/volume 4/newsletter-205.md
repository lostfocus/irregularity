Hello internet friends!

I'm sitting here in the setting sun, listening to Pitbull. Which is exactly the reason why I didn't add Spotify to my Tinder profile, I mean - I don't need *yet another* reason to hardly ever have a match there. 

**Oh, no, it’s Dave again.**

*Confession corner:* I quite like the whole idea of late night talk shows. A bit of mediocre stand-up, some banter with a sidekick while sitting at a desk, an interview or two with some random celebrity that might or might not be scripted in advance, some music - what else would you need on television before going to bed? (Actually I hardly ever watch these before going to bed. I watch them randomly on YouTube during my lunch break. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)  
One of the all time great hosts of these kinds of shows is David Letterman. And while he's not doing *that* anymore, he did give [this really good interview](http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/david-letterman-in-conversation.html).

**Uncle Licky**

It seems like *everybody* loves the new Nintendo Switch and even I ponder if it's something I might want to have. It's the first Nintendo thing since the Wii that actually seems interesting - but maybe that's just the hype talking. And because everybody is also a bit of an idiot it is now a thing to [lick the Switch cartridges](https://mic.com/articles/170024/people-are-tasting-nintendo-switch-game-cartridges-and-apparently-they-re-disgusting). Because they intentionally made them that way to keep people from eating them.

**The dangers of wearing no pants at work**

Yes, *yes*, we have all seen the BBC video with the intruding children by now. But do we know exactly why everybody shared it? To learn more, [a proper *analyst* breaks it down for us step by step](https://medium.com/@benthompson/breaking-down-the-father-on-bbc-being-interrupted-by-his-children-9840cdc8857b). 

**Evil dog news**

Not evil news about dogs. News that dogs are evil.  
Or that [dogs are at least *very* good at manipulating humans into doing their biding.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/13/dogs-best-friend-least-honest-friend) Which, as the lady in the article says, should come as no surprise to anyone who was ever in the vicinity of a dog.

**I'd tap *that* island**

*Turns out* you can learn a lot about people if you work at the same place for twenty years, especially if you have a lot and very passionate customers. Mark Rosewater, the head designer of Magic: the Gathering, sure did. And [he shared twenty lessons in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHHg99hwQGY). (Warning: long video.)  
And because he knows that some people rather don't watch a long video, here it is as an [article for actual reading](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-1-2016-05-30). (Well… in three parts. The [second](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-2-2016-06-06) and [third](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-3-2016-06-13) parts are available, too. So now you get to read three long articles.)

**Humans need not apply**

We've already managed to create embryos without any male involvement, but now [some scientists managed to create one without an egg](https://mic.com/articles/170661/scientists-have-created-an-artificial-embryo), just using stem cells. I'm pretty sure we're heading towards a future where life isn't really needed to create life anymore.
