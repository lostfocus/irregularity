Hello internet friends!

It's April 3rd and, wow, luckily it's not April 1st anymore and *the jokes are over.* Who likes these things anyway and why are they still around? [The Verge is on it.](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/31/15076050/april-fools-day-pranks-jokes-terrible) (tl;dr: because *brands*)

**Big Duck News**

[Last october](http://irregularity.co/35-duck-analogies/) we learned that [big dinosaurs quacked](http://nerdist.com/dinosaurs-didnt-roar-they-cooed-or-quacked-like-ducks-says-new-study/). Now we actually know (for variable values of "know") how at least one of them looks like: [For the first time, we know what Tyrannosaur faces really looked like](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/new-discovery-reveals-tyrannosaur-faces-for-the-first-time/). Go ahead, click that link. Just for that last paragraph.

**Egg News**

[Twitter got rid of the eggs.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/03/twitter-drops-egg-avatar-in-attempt-to-break-association-with-internet-trolls) Now before you rejoice, let's take a break. They didn't *actually* get rid of the egg people, they just got them a new icon. Now how clever is that?

**Robot News**

On some days interacting with fellow human beings is just *so hard.* Sometimes these days coincide with days when there is no more food in the kitchen. *Ugh.* So basically at this point there are two options: actually do grocery shopping or order some food. Both of them require a tiny bit of human interaction.  
Well, at least until now - [Domino’s and Starship Technologies will deliver pizza by robot in Europe this summer](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/dominos-and-starship-technologies-will-deliver-pizza-by-robot-in-europe-this-summer/). Honestly the first time I read something that might make me want to move to Hamburg.

**Uh-oh**

As you can imagine, just from that previous section, any article that starts with "Talking to other humans, GOOD or BAD? It's hard to say for sure." speaks to me on a deep level. And since I'm a big fan of talking to people by typing (hi!) here we go: [Messaging Apps, Ranked](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/best-messaging-apps-ranked)  
I'm not sure I 100% agree on their results, but it's a fun read anyway.

Well… toodles!
