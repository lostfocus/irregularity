Hello internet friends,

did you ever wonder how fireflies in Thailand synchronize their blinking? Yeah, me neither. But now I know and it is fascinating. And the [webpage that explains it](http://ncase.me/fireflies/) is absolutely wonderful.

**Computer Talk**

Just now as I am writing this the latest Apple keynote thing ended. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Let's talk about *real* computers instead and what happened with those back in the days: [What Really Happened with Vista](https://hackernoon.com/what-really-happened-with-vista-4ca7ffb5a1a)  
Medium Dot Com says it takes 27 minutes to read it, sooooo… about how long Vista lasted from start-up to the first background process crashing.

**Butt Talk**

So apparently this is a topic? [Why did my boyfriend like Emily Ratajkowski's butt on Instagram?](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/4/15721836/emily-ratajkowski-emrata-instagram-like)

**Bird Talk**

A warning, just in case: [Two Escaped Raptors Are Still At Large in North Carolina](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/two-escaped-raptors-are-still-at-large-in-north-carolina-secretary-birds)  
Not dinosaurs, though. Talking about big birds - did you ever wonder about [Why Flamingos Are More Stable on One Leg Than Two](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/flamingos-one-leg/527781/)? 

**Brick Talk**

[How Lego clicked: the super brand that reinvented itself](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/04/how-lego-clicked-the-super-brand-that-reinvented-itself) - nothing *really* new in that article, but it's still nicely put together.  
Meanwhile in assorted Lego talk, a nice love letter to the Lego Movie's cracked space man helmet: [Cracked Helmets and Being Understood](http://jayposey.com/cracked-helmets-and-being-understood/)
