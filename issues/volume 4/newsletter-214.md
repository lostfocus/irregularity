Hello internet friends,

if you use twitter - and oh boy, do I understand a "oh hell no!" reaction to that idea - you probably have seen the account that rates dogs. Today we learn about the guy behind it: [We Rate Dogs -  Matt Nelson Turned Joke Twitter Account Into Successful Business](http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a54940/we-rate-dogs-matt-nelson-interview/) Overall [he seem to be a pretty okay dude](https://twitter.com/warmandpunchy/status/829104431677452291/).

**@dino_rates**

This is *Nodo*. He likes to eat plants and looks fantastic in his armor. 12/10 would pet.

[The Amazing Dinosaur Found (Accidentally) by Miners in Canada](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/06/dinosaur-nodosaur-fossil-discovery/) - that is indeed pretty amazing. I can't really see the feathers, though.

**@convo_rates**

This is *Talking About Weather.* It helps to connect people who might not have much in common and works well to bridge awkward silences. 10/10 would talk again.

[Letter of Recommendation: Talking About the Weather](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-talking-about-the-weather.html) - I'm all for it. At the moment I have to interact with a whole bunch of different people and since somehow everybody is either talking about football or the weather and I don't know anything about football, I'm all for having this rather safe subject.

**@car_rates**

These are *Group B rally cars.* They're very fast and loud and amazingly unsafe. 13/10 would watch.

[Group B rally cars are awesome, and we just drove some](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/group-b-rally-cars-are-awesome-and-we-just-drove-some/) - to be fair, they "only" drove two of the not all that famous ones, but these are still lovely little cars.

**@clone_rates**

These are *Guy Fieri, the Guy From Smash Mouth, and the Guy From Insane Clown Posse.* They're probably clones.  
And now we need to break character - they're probably not very good clones, either.

But the theory that they are clones is a good one: [A Unified Theory of Guy Fieri, the Guy From Smash Mouth, and the Guy From Insane Clown Posse Being the Same Person (and/or Clones)](https://theringer.com/guy-fieri-smash-mouth-insane-clown-posse-clones-theory-f431faafe764) - so there is that. Let's just do it this way. 11/10 would meme again.

**@robot_rates**

This is *robot falcon.* It warns real birds of dangerous areas. What a hero. 14/10 how nice.

[Robo-Falcons Will Scare Off Actual Live Birds at the Edmonton Airport](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/edmonton-airport-robirds-drones-first-aviation) - If that works this sounds like a great solution. And maybe even fun for someone who gets to chase birds with that little drone.
