Hello internet friends!

Don't worry, I didn't forget you today. (To be honest, though: I almost did. Long day at work, then went and sat around in the sun a bit to read. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)

**Juicy**

I'm still laughing about the Juicero. A 400USD WiFi-connected machine that squeezes very expensive juice out of aluminium pouches. Just like this dude [I Just Love This Juicero Story So Much:](http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/i-just-love-this-juicero-story-so-much-1794459898) People just squeeze the bags. How dare they. [Juicero CEO Begs You: Do NOT Squeeze Our Juice Bags](http://gizmodo.com/juicero-ceo-begs-you-do-not-open-our-juice-bags-1794507811)  
But you know, it's not only snark here. There's even some meta snark about what ~we~ can learn from the whole thing: [How Juicero's Story Set the Company Up for Humiliation](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/juicero-lessons/523896/)

**Show-y**

I really liked the whole kottke.org guest host week last week. Mostly because what Tim Carmody collected as [best of the web](http://kottke.org/tag/best%20of%20the%20web) pretty much hits the nerve of old-school web geeks like me.  
And then of course there's the article on [Ze Frank's The Show](http://kottke.org/17/04/ze-franks-the-show) which was basically a daily vlog before daily vlogs were even a thing. (There was a reboot, which was… underwhelming. But, eh… let's remember simpler times when an US president Bush was the worst thing we could imagine for the world. And [let's watch the monkey dance](http://kottke.org/17/04/ze-franks-the-show). With a free advice by a young pre-fame Chelsea Peretti. Whose brother is now Ze Frank's boss.)

**Instagramable**

Finally, an article about a hashtag: [#Vanlife, the Bohemian Social-Media Movement](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/vanlife-the-bohemian-social-media-movement)  
This is actually a rather interesting and realistic look into what it takes to be a *social media influencer* these days.

**Brains**

The fact that there are actual real life people who think that this is a good idea is just boggling my mind: [We Are Entering the Era of the Brain Machine Interface](https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3)  
It's bad enough when people have to use some skill to interface with ~the machine~ - do we really want to lower that bar even more?
