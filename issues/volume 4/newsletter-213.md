Hello internet friends,

it is Monday again. The weekend is over. But what is a weekend, really? [A Marxist might point out that the weekend is an act of corporate trickery, a dangling carrot that keeps workers tethered to their jobs.](https://qz.com/969245/it-took-a-century-to-create-the-weekend-and-only-a-decade-to-undo-it/)

**Rollercoaster**

I pretty much enjoy the diverse Tycoon games - you might remember them from *yore* - Transport Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon and some more. I don't enjoy them as much as this guy, though: [Player Spends A Decade Polishing Epic Theme Park In *Rollercoaster Tycoon 2*](http://kotaku.com/player-spends-a-decade-polishing-epic-theme-park-in-rol-1794982535)  
And that is indeed a pretty epic theme park.

**Listening**

Good god. [More Android phones than ever are covertly listening for inaudible sounds in ads](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/theres-a-spike-in-android-apps-that-covertly-listen-for-inaudible-sounds-in-ads/) 

**Runner**

I honestly don't know what to think about the [trailer for Blade Runner 2049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcx85zbxz4).  
Mostly it isâ€¦ too much? We'll see. I'm not hoping for much.

**Railroad**

I mean, sure - [Japan's Newest Train Is Basically a Luxury Hotel on Rails](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/05/the-significance-of-japans-new-luxury-train/525402/) - but which Belgian detective will have to solve a murder on that one?

That's all for this week. Stay strong.  
Toodles!
