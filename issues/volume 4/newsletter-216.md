Hello internet friends,

annoyed that it is Monday already? Well, you're probably less annoyed than these [rattlesnakes being pestered with a drone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v97KrZTzYWU).

**Web Content**

We humans have a brain (usually) and a spine (some) and that's how we think and handle the various parts of our body. But not every animal works like this - so, for example, how do spiders and octopuses think? [The Thoughts of a Spiderweb](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-thoughts-of-a-spiderweb-20170523/)

**Cheese Content**

Living just over the boarder from Switzerland, their various cheese dishes - mostly fondue and raclette - were a very normal part of my upbringing. And given that "melting cheese" is one of the great culinary achievements it is important to know [The Science of Melting Cheese](http://luckypeach.com/guides/science-melting-cheese/).

**Car Content**

In this case actual literal car content: [Singapore 'vending machine' dispenses Ferraris, Lamborghinis](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-singapore-idUSKCN18B1KM).  
I know this concept with Smart cars over here, butâ€¦ wow. (Unrelated: the movie adaptation of [Crazy Rich Asians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Rich_Asians) is currently filming.)

**Rihanna and Lupita Nyong'o Content**

I really like everything about this: [A meme come true: Rihanna and Lupita Nyong'o to star in film based on tweet](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/22/rihanna-lupita-nyongo-viral-photo-netflix-movie-ava-duvernay)  
Tweet-to-Netflix is the *content* version of Farm-to-Table, right?

Now go outside, have a drink.  
Toodles!
