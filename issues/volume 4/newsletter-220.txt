Hello internet friends,

let's start with something *really* important: [Fact-checking Owl City’s description of being hugged by 10,000 fireflies](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/6/21/15846542/owl-city-fireflies-explanation-adam-young-entomologist)  
Okay, maybe not that important, but now that I have *that* song stuck in my ears I wanted to share that joy with you. Sharing is caring.

**Mistress**

Apparently this is a real job: [China’s Mistress-Dispellers](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/26/chinas-mistress-dispellers) and that is pretty fascinating. Would I watch a Netflix series about these people? I probably would.

**Leaks**

There is a whole sector of the publishing industry devoted to rumors and leaks around technology products, mostly those from Apple.

Good god.

**Skating**

I really enjoyed this article on how [Learning to Skateboard When You're an Adult Is Extremely Embarrassing](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qv4dmm/learning-to-skateboard-when-youre-an-adult-is-extremely-embarrassing).  
(Side note: is is a coincidence that the Broadly text logo is so similar to the German Brigitte?)

**Bees!**

I can't wait for a future where Amazon plants big beehives for their delivery drones into cities - maybe built by nanobots and with structures completely planned by deep learning AIs: [Amazon’s vision for the future: delivery drone beehives in every city](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15860668/amazon-drone-delivery-patent-city-centers)
The [MetaFilter thread for this article](http://www.metafilter.com/167824/Amazons-Dystopia-As-A-Service) is gold, especially but not only for this comment:

> 2037: CAPTCHA's grow more strict every year. Slip up, and you're locked out of your Amazon account, your apartment, your job, your life. Renegades hide out in abandoned big-box stores and survive on what they can shoot down. Arecibo Noether, daughter of elite Prime Members, never thought she would end up as one of them but

Once again: I would totally read/watch this.

Toodles!
