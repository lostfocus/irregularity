Hello internet friends,

let's start with some *great* news: [We are going to Mars!](https://futurism.com/its-official-humans-are-going-to-mars-nasa-has-unveiled-their-mission/)[^we]

[^we]: By now I can assume you understand this kind of "we" as in "we humans"  and not some kind of "we, including you and me," right? Because I'm not going to and I doubt any future Mars astronaut is reading these emails.

**eBooks**

I like to read a lot, usually medium-agnostic. Paper, digital, whatever. (In fact, if I could, I'd have a "eat, sleep, read, repeat" lifestyle, but… eh.) Apparently one of my favourite ways to read - if only because it hides my tsundoku better - is just not cool anymore: [How eBooks lost their shine: 'Kindles now look clunky and unhip'](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/how-ebooks-lost-their-shine-kindles-look-clunky-unhip-)  
But then that's alright with me - after all I'm clunky and unhip, too.

**Fyre Fyre**

I don't even mind being clunky and unhip - because if I weren't I might be in the Bahamas now, being angry: ['Rich kids of Instagram meets Hunger Games': Guests at luxury Fyre Festival where tickets cost $12,000 'mugged, stranded and hungry'](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/fyre-festival-instagram-friendly-music-event-12000-tickets-turns/)  
Who would have seen that coming? Apparently not this dude [Fyre Festival Head Billy McFarland: 'We Were a Little Naive'](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/fyre-fest-head-billy-mcfarland-we-were-a-little-naive-w479502) even when people who know what they were talking about saw a whole lot of warning signs: [I Worked at Fyre Festival. It Was Always Going to Be a Disaster.](http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/fyre-festival-exumas-bahamas-disaster.html)

**Game, Set, Match**

I present to you: important journalism. [Was Uber’s CEO really the second-best Wii Sports tennis player?](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/was-ubers-ceo-really-the-second-best-wii-sports-tennis-player/) (Not *important* per se but very amusing in either way. His uncle said so.)

**Hail Robot**

Just in case you wonder: [Is Wall-E Satan?](http://io9.gizmodo.com/new-fan-theory-asks-the-obvious-question-is-wall-e-sat-1794599080)

Now have a good May 1st. And maybe you get an incovenient rash if you celebrate [Loyalty Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_Day) instead of [International Worker's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day) today.

Toodles!
