Hello internet friends!

Good news, everybody: [Sperm count drop 'could make humans extinct'](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40719743)  
(And also, come on. We're *this* close to getting science to a point where we don't need sperm anymore anyway. (Or are we at this point already? I'm not really up-to-date on reproductive science.))

**Nude**

Just in case you wonder how *that* is like: [Spending a Week in theÂ Nude](https://www.racked.com/2017/7/25/16005206/nudist-retreat-naturist-society)  
This is good reporting right there.

**Squash**

Talking about good reporting: [I watched in bewilderment while a man tried to return butternut squash because he thought it was cheese](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/7/24/16019286/squash-cheese-grocery-store)  

**Atemlos**

A: Yes.

**Scam**

Even if you're not into podcasts, you might want to make an exception for that one: [Long Distance by Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/long-distance/).  
These people went ahead and decided to research who is behind a tech support scam call.

**Ship**

This is weirder than what most writers of thrillers come up with: [The Hijacking of the Brillante Virtuoso](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-hijacking-of-brillante-virtuoso/)  
What a name for a tanker, too.
