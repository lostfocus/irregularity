Hello internet friends,

good news! [We finally have eco-friendly glitter!](https://www.racked.com/2017/8/1/16003528/glitter-environment-bioglitz)  
…  
Oh well.

**Aziz Ansari**

[Aziz Ansari on Quitting the Internet, Loneliness, and Season 3 of Master of None](http://www.gq.com/story/aziz-ansari-gq-style-cover-story) is really worth reading. And the whole unplugging from the *internet of content* is a smart idea. Well… you know. Except what would happen to these emails here if I did that?  
It's not like anyone would want to read my ponderings on books I read.

**Trent Reznor**

Another interview with a *creative* person: In Conversation: [Trent Reznor](http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails.html). He's a bit the grumpy old man here but again, worth reading.

**Bikes**

This is pretty great: [Inside the fearless bike movement tearing up London](http://www.huckmagazine.com/ride/bikes/bikestormz-movement-cycling-bikelife-survival-london/). Both the movement and the article.

**McLaren**

On the other spectrum of transportation is one of the greatest cars in the world. And now you know as well [What Made the McLaren F1 the World's Greatest Car](http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a10368266/the-complete-oral-history-of-the-mclaren-f1/).  

**Love Motel**

I honestly don't know what to make of these photos, but they sure are interesting: [Under the Covers at Taiwan’s Tacky ‘Love Motels’](https://www.topic.com/under-the-covers-at-taiwans-tacky-love-motels). And now I know there is a big enough market for people with a Miata fetish to make one of those rooms work.
