Hello internet friends,

I hope you all had a nice time playing with some eggs this weekend, but here we go - another Monday!

**Furious**

There's a new Fast and Furious movie and this time it is not about tuna sandwiches. (Or tuner sandwiches. Ha. Ha. Sorry.) But what is it about? Well, some *journalists* did the maths and now we know: 
[These Graphics Chart The Decline In Street Races And NOS In Fast And Furious Movies](http://jalopnik.com/these-graphics-chart-the-decline-in-street-races-and-no-1794263480)  
Important work.

**Audio Hack**

These days voice is a command line to networked computers. So what Burger King did - [hijacking the Google Assistant](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/04/google-burger-king-feud-over-control-of-the-google-assistant/) for a commercial - is basically a hack. Tzk.  
(Also, ha, ha, "hack" is also the German word for minced meat. Which is on burgers. I'm sorry. Again.)

**Emoji**

Maybe you're living somewhere where it is still a public holiday today. Then you might have enough time to watch this rather nerdy and very interesting talk about the whole history of emoji and how they work: [Emoji for fun and profit](http://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/emoji-fun-profit/)  

**Chicken Music**

Guess which company sells more than half a million music CDs a month in Indonesia. I bet you didn't guess KFC, but that's what is happening: [Selling CDs in Indonesiaâ€™s KFCs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/arts/music/steve-lillywhite-kfc-sell-cds-indonesia.html?_r=0).  
Do you want to have more chicken stuff from Indonesia? Well, there is [Gereja Ayam, the Abandoned Chicken Church](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gereja-ayam-the-abandoned-chicken-church) for you. Or maybe you're more interested in music? Here are some young Indonesian ladies who like to rock: [Teenage metal hijabi girl band slays stereotypes, melts faces with funktastic music in Indonesia](https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/watch-teenage-metal-hijabi-girl-band-shatters-stereotypes-melts-faces-funktastic-music-indonesia/).

**Australia**

Just read it all the way through: [Australian rapper skips dinner bill by swimming off, court told](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39552461) It's a short as it is amusing.

Toodles!
