Hello internet friends,

I've had *declining* hair for a while now and yet every summer I am surprised again that the sun actually has an effect on my head. Maybe I should get some sort of person who holds an umbrella over my all the time? Or maybe just a hat, but that seems overkill.

Same.

**Cat Scan**

Now, all things considered, I'm more a dog person than a cat person. Mostly because I start to look like an extra in a zombie movie right after a cat was somewhere near. And yet, this is fascinating: [Watch the History of Cat Domestication in Three Minutes](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/watch-the-history-of-cat-domestication-in-three-minutes)

**Beep Beep**

*Maybe* I'm a bit stupid, after all I'm not in San Francisco, but - isn't this just a private bus line? [Lyft’s New Shuttle Service Is More Convenient Than Lyft Line](https://lifehacker.com/lyft-s-new-shuttle-service-is-more-convenient-than-lyft-1796167137)

**Wood**

These are pretty incredible: [Now You Can Download 2,500 Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Library of Congress](https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/now-you-can-download-2500-japanese-woodblock-prints-from-the-library-of-congress)  
I might just have spent a little too much time clicking through these.

**Merch**

✊ Resistance!  
Well. More like Resistance™ - because capitalism is really good at turning everything into a commodity: [The Resistance Will Be Merchandised](http://www.gq.com/story/the-resistance-will-be-merchandised). 

**Coke**

If you watch a comedic movie that was sort of aimed at more grown-up people, you probably see at least one person doing coke. Why? [How Did Cocaine Become The Drug Of Choice In Hard-R Comedies?](http://decider.com/2017/06/16/cocaine-in-comedy/)  
(I thought it was because everybody in Hollywood is on the stuff anyway all the time, but apparently there are other reasons.)
