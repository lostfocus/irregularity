Hello internet friends!

Spring arrived here in full force so here I am, all doped up on antihistamines and hiding behind my sunglasses.  
Onwards!

Self-driving cars *might* be the future but maybe they future has been around all along: [The future of driverless cars is a bus](https://theoutline.com/post/1349/the-future-of-driverless-cars-is-a-bus)  
Mostly it looks like they took the PRTs from Heathrow (wait - weren't those [supposed to be a joke](http://irregularity.co/45-a-sad-parody/)?) and put them on the public roads. Something that's honestly a pretty good idea. Especially as driverless technology gets better and better.

I'll be the first to admit - I did not know what a chinese *Husband Exhibition* might be. Now I know: apparently it's some kind of festival where the chinese music industry markets their pop stars to a mostly female crowd - as charming enough to be their husband. Some of those pop stars might even be young ladies, who just happen to be very androgynous and (have to) play football: [Chinaâ€™s hottest new boy band is actually made up of five androgynous girls.](https://qz.com/944691/ffc-acrush-chinas-hottest-new-boy-band-is-actually-made-up-of-five-androgynous-girls/)

Space news! So, [mysterious bursts of energy do come from outer space](https://phys.org/news/2017-04-mysterious-energy-outer-space.html). It is probably just some stupid physics thing but who knows - maybe someone out there is scanning our planet.

Quick, name one of the big artists of our time. You'll probably not name Pitbull, but that might be a mistake. Because [Pitbull Will Live Forever](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/pitbull-will-live-forever).  
Fascinating.

**Helter Skelter**

Not a headline I expected to read in 2017: [The Hippies Have Won](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/dining/health-food-hippies-restaurants-vegetarian.html?nytmobile=0&_r=0). Now before we all cheer and strip naked and run around circles around our VW vans in a cloud of marijuana smoke, let's be clear: it's not that the age of aquarius has finally come. It's just that *capitalism* managed to co-opt the superficialities of the lifestyle and now granola, kombucha and Birkenstocks have taken over the world.  
Well, what a bum trip.

Well, be safe out there. Make sure there are no shards of glass around when you do decide to dance naked around your camper van.  
Toodles!
