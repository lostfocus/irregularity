Hello internet friends,

want to feel old? [Avril Lavigne’s Sk8er Boi came out 15 years ago today, and it’s just as brilliant now as it was then](https://medium.com/@lunkavitch/avril-lavignes-sk8er-boi-came-out-15-years-ago-today-and-it-s-just-as-brilliant-now-as-it-was-4c0b2bf177f6).

**Octopodes**

You know you're in for a ride when a properly long article about octopodes (octopuses?) starts with a detailed discussion about the world's first tentacle porn. [The Sucker, the Sucker!](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n17/amia-srinivasan/the-sucker-the-sucker) is that article and it is great.

**Memes**

Probably one of the most reassuring sentences I have read in a while: [We Are Not Worried About the Meme Situation](http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/08/antonio-guillem-the-photographer-behind-guy-looking-back-meme.html)

**Doping**

We often hear about professional sports people (¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯) and their doping habits. I'm not much of a sports person, so I've never considered following their lead, but others are a bit more adventurous: [I Doped Like Maria Sharapova And It Was Actually Pretty Great](http://deadspin.com/i-doped-like-maria-sharapova-and-it-was-actually-pretty-1798352480)

**Clowning**

I remember how one of the biggest scandals back in high school was when one parent learned that their son had borrowed Stephen King's It from a classmate. The whole discussion about that was very exhausting for *everybody* - even without reading the book. Turns out that this is not a much better experience either: Reading [Stephen King’s It is an exhausting way to spend a summer](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16028300/stephen-king-it-movie-adaptation-book-recap-horror-summer)
