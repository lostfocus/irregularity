Hello internet friends,

don't you also hate that feeling when you accidentally find an old photo of an alien and somehow [it turns into this whole big thing](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/30/alien-photo-roswell-new-mexico-mystery)? So relatable.

**Museum**

Quick, when was the last time you visited a museum? Do you have any plans to go soon? Hmmhmm. And now how about when I tell you about [Selfie Factories: The Rise of the Made-for-Instagram Museum](https://www.wired.com/story/selfie-factories-instagram-museum/)?  
(This has been in a slightly mocking tone. I know that I have a rather museum-savvy readership.)

**Unknown**

It might be peculiar but just like so many people I often enjoy watching people play computer games more than actually playing myself. Usually I watch Starcraft 2 matches, because I can actually understand what is going on, but lately Playerunknown's Battlegrounds has been high on the list, especially [Polygon's Awful Squad](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT5xZKh7TsCL4ydk7TOduLeu). I'm not particularly alone in that case, PUBG is a huge hit this year and its main developer is quite in demand these days: [Brendan "Playerunknown" Greene's whirlwind year](https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/11/16272752/brendan-playerunknown-greenes-whirlwind-year)  
Besides being entertaining to watch the game has some other rather entertaining use cases: [The art (and stupidity) of taking 360 panoramas in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.](https://revdancatt.com/2017/09/16/360PUBG)

**Meditation**

We've all seen these articles or have heard the advice that meditation is supposed to be *the best thing ever.* I've always been very sceptical because nothing sounds more scary to me than being alone with my thoughts for even the shortest amount of time. So *obviously* I'll smugly share this link: [Thereâ€™s a dark side to meditation that no one talks about](https://qz.com/993465/theres-a-dark-side-to-meditation-that-no-one-talks-about/)

**Moon**

Yeah! [Russia Will Team Up with NASA to Build a Lunar Space Station](http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/news/a28304/russia-nasa-cis-lunar/)  
Maybe at least up there we humans can be chill and work together? Not bloody likely, but let's hope so.

That's all for this week, toodles!

(Not *all,* all, obviously. There is also this very [well made and written article about group chats](https://theoutline.com/post/2315/long-live-the-group-chat). And yeah, I'm pretty glad I didn't [pivot to video](https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/pivot-to-video.php).)
