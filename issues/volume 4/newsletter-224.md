Hello internet friends,

yes, *obviously* [it is *problematic*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thpEyEwi80) but [The Fifth Element](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/) is easily one of my favourite movies. (Just so you know, [your fave is problematic](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/problematic-fave).) And it's not just the visuals, it is actually [the story](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/07/how-the-fifth-element-subverted-sci-fi-movies/534108/), too.

**bus-y**

[Citymapper announces 'hyper-local multi-passenger pooled vehicle'](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/20/citymapper-bus-london-aldgate-east-highbury-and-islington-tfl) - which is, as you might have guessed, a bus. With all the hullabaloo around self-driving cars and on-demand mobility in the end a proper, well-working and affordable public transport is probably still the best solution for most cities. And it is actually a smart move by Citymapper to use their data to identify demand for this line and use the [*desire path*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path).

**duck-y**

By now we know that dinosaurs had feathers and made duck-like sounds. (If not, news flash: they had feathers and made duck-like sounds.) And the most fearsome of them, the gigantic feather, quacking Tyrannosaurs Rex wasn't even that fast, either: [Tyrannosaurus Rex Would Break Its Own Legs if It Chased Jeff Goldblum IRL](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xakjp/tyrannosaurus-rex-would-break-its-own-legs-if-it-chased-jeff-goldblum-irl).  
Good news for Jeff Goldblum, I guess.

**henge-y**

[We may have cracked the mystery of Stonehenge](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170713-why-stonehenge-was-built). "May" being the word here. And while that "may" is still a "may" let's look at videos instead. For example: [Decoding the ancient astronomy of Stonehenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx-KrvuiafE) Or you knowâ€¦ [that one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyzgeee2mg)

**binks-y**

This guy, more than anyone in the world, should be thankful that CGI was around when they made the Star Wars prequels: [How the Guy Who Played Jar Jar Binks Survived the Fandom Menace](https://www.wired.com/2017/07/ahmed-best-jar-jar-binks-new-podcast/)
