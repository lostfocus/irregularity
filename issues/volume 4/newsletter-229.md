Hello internet friends,

did you ever sit and wonder: [Why are there so many knobs in GarageBand?](https://theoutline.com/post/2157/why-are-there-so-many-knobs-in-garage-band) Well, that article doesn't help much, but it has many amazingly ugly screenshots.  
(The answer might be: because there are so many knobs in bands.)

**Nerd Alert**

[Two weeks ago](http://irregularity.co/24-things-on-maps/) we talked about flightradar24 here. If you liked this, you might want to know [How Flightradar24 conquered the skies – and why the Pope's travel plans cause a surge in traffic](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/flightradar24-what-how-works-fredrik-lindahl/)

**Nerd Alert (2)**  
*(Side note: maybe I should have just called the whole newsletter nerd alert, because… well. You know.)*

Also not the first time we talk about fictional maps - pretty much one year ago [I linked](http://irregularity.co/25-cities-real-imagined-and-lost/) to my still favorite twitter bot [@unchartedatlas](https://twitter.com/unchartedatlas) and in February [we talked about](http://irregularity.co/52-beer-stars/) how much [we like books with maps](https://www.theawl.com/2012/02/the-maps-we-wandered-into-as-kids/). Now here is a really deep dive into fantasy maps and what they *mean*: [Here at the End of All Things](https://longreads.com/2017/08/24/fantasy-maps-game-of-thrones/)

**Nerd Alert (3)**

Planespotting, fantasy maps, how do we get this email to be even more nerdy? Well, let's add maths *and* history! [Did the Babylonians Beat the Greeks to Trigonometry By 1000 Years?](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/neeq8k/did-the-babylonians-beat-the-greeks-to-trigonometry-by-1000-yearsab)  
The answer - as usual - is "it might be" but the probability is pretty high. And hey, cuneiform.

**Mushrooms!**

Not a super nerdy topic, I guess, but hey: [How Mushrooms Became Magic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/how-mushrooms-became-magic/537789/) This is pretty fascinating.
