Humanity is now breeding cows for secondary characteristics: [Canada Is Using Genetics to Make Cows Less Gassy](https://www.wired.com/story/canada-is-using-genetics-to-make-cows-less-gassy)

*I know.* But. This article is actually really good: [Welcome to Poppy’s World](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/shes-poppy/). (And hey, she did get a shout-out at the latest Apple Keynote, so… ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)  
In the article they mention an ad campaign for Sanrio. Part of that is [an interview](https://www.sanrio.com/blog_entries/meet-our-new-friend-that-poppy) which includes this gem of a dialogue:

> *Sweet Happy News:* When is the last time you really felt alive?  
	*That Poppy:* I feel alive every time my phone is re-charged.  
	*Sweet Happy News:* Amazing.

Toodles!
