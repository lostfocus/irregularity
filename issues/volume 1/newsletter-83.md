Hello, internet friends!

How nice to see all of you still reading this, it means a lot to me.  

I never heard of "[Lucky Peach](http://luckypeach.com/)" before, but at the moment they cover a topic near and dear to my heart: ramen.  
There's a biography of [Momofuko Ando](http://luckypeach.com/mankind-is-noodlekind-momofuku-ando-and-the-invention-of-instant-ramen/), a [timeline of the history of ramen](http://luckypeach.com/a-timeline-of-ramen-development/) and a [guide to the different types of ramen](http://luckypeach.com/a-guide-to-the-regional-ramen-of-japan/).  
Now excuse me while I hide a bit in the corner and cry about the fact that the only way to get some halfway decent ramen nearby where I stay  [just got way more expensive](http://qz.com/327410/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-understand-what-happened-to-the-swiss-franc-this-week/).

Since we're already on the subject of Switzerland: if you happen to be a robot that orders illegal substances and fake passports over the internet, [the Swiss police will come and arrest you](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/random-darknet-shopper-seized/).  
2015.

In a very different way just as cyberpunk-y (if not more so) as robots in jail: [turning a modern inexpensive compact camera into a waist-level Rolleiflex replica](http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/10711/is-waist-level-photography-with-a-digital-camera-practical/45183#45183).  
I am pretty sure there's someone thinking about putting a pre-made kit for these up on Kickstarter.

More things that are old: [coyotes](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/14/how-extinction-changed-the-coyote/), [British mars spacecrafts](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/16/lost-beagle-2-spacecraft-found-mars), [VHS tapes and old websites](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3040491/how-old-vhs-tapes-helped-save-early-web-design).  
Me, especially on Monday mornings.

Have a good week, take care.  
Eat your vegetables.
