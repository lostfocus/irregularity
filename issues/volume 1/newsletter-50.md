Hello, internet friends!

Before we start with anything, let me give you the link to a properly useful article, full of proven career advice: [10 Tricks to Appear Smart During Meetings](https://medium.com/comedy-corner/10-tricks-to-appear-smart-during-meetings-27b489a39d1a).

Now that the LinkedIn crowd is gone, (and depending on their intellectual ability amused, offended, befuddled or any mix of those three) let's talk internet.

As I have [mentioned before](http://irregularity.co/32-everybody-got-their-something/), (You don't *need* to click this, it goes back to an old issue.) one of my early summer rituals is to re-read "The Beach." It's a pretty quick read that works fine when read on the first warm evening of the year.  
It's also a bit of a (very shaky) allegory for "the internet" - because [this is basically the internet now.](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2014/the-worst-party-in-asia/)  
Either that or I am getting old and finally blooming into my true form as constantly grumpy middle-aged dude. Or maybe I should just stop reading the internet for a while. Or unfollow the outrage crowd.  

Maybe instead of tech articles, which tend to make me grumpy, I should just read fascinating articles like this one about [ad-hoc transit in New York](http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/projects/nyc-dollar-vans/).

Have a good day. And if you don't: this too shall pass.
