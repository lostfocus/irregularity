Hello, internet friends!

A new week ahead! That means we're all a week older, yay.
So far today, I had one cup of coffee, a glass of water and a pretzel. You subscribed to these emails for this important information.

Onwards and upwards: the US west coast had an earthquake on the weekend and this is how it affected sleep in that area - according to [Jawbone sleep data](https://jawbone.com/blog/napa-earthquake-effect-on-sleep/). 

At the same time, I watched some [pretty clouds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg4CH9JEAC8) moving around outside my living room window.  
I posted that video with "TW: Boring" on Tumblr and it didn't take very long until I got an angry message, that I shouldn't make fun of trigger warnings and that I am The Problem.  
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Constant source of amusement: [Cloud to Butt Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai?hl=en).

That's all, maybe you guys saw/found something intrigueing during the weekend? Hit reply and let me know. (That might now look like some silly social media manager trick to "drive engagement" but I'd seriously like to know: all I did this weekend was trying to find out how to make those time lapse videos, watch the F1 race and sleep. So… my brain is not only wide open but actually yearning for interesting stuff.)

Hang in there.
