Hello, internet friends!

I really hope you're all wide awake and full of energy - I am very much neither of these things. A weekend with little sleep in Berlin does that to old couch-potatoes like me.  
Oh well. Onwards!

I did not watch the Oscars and so far the internet has been a huge disappointment - except for some "We live-tweeted the Oscars, here are all of our context-free tweets on one webpage" sites I did not find any good recap. Or even *thinkpiece*.  
But then I probably did not watch any of the movies that won anyway, because lol, who has the time to watch a movie when we all *have to* binge-watch *all the great shows* on TV.

At least I now know [whatâ€™s it like being a seat filler at the Academy Awards](http://www.avclub.com/article/whats-it-being-seat-filler-academy-awards-214360)  and then there is that TV series I will not ever binge watch. Luckily I don't have to, [because someone did it for me](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/two-and-a-half-men-tvs-worst-sitcom-ends-as-terribly-as-it-lived-and-i-watched-every-episode/).

It's a lovely story: Matt Stopera over on Buzzfeed had his phone stolen - and suddenly [he found pictures of a chinese guy](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/who-is-this-man-and-why-are-his-photos-showing-up-on-my-phon#.gs9x5JOJvz) on it. I'm sure he'll soon be best friends with [his Brother Orange](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/how-i-became-a-minor-celebrity-in-china-after-my#.qudVLEXE60).

A lot less lovely is what *the people in the shadows* do to our [computers](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/02/19/lenovo-caught-installing-adware-new-computers/) and our [cellphones](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/). I am not amused.

Have a good week, everybody. Eat your vegetables.
