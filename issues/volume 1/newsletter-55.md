Hello, internet friends! Remember me?

Now how about this - you can turn your selfies into stickers for text messages with [this app](http://www.imojiapp.com/).[^selfies]

[^selfies]: I know you guys are exactly the kind of people who get really excited about apps like that. Am I right?

A couple of weeks ago the internet was furious - furious! - that [Facebook played around with their feed algorithm](http://www.avclub.com/article/facebook-tinkered-users-feeds-massive-psychology-e-206324) to see what kind of effect it has on people. Now OKCupid admits to [doing the same, sort of, and more of it](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/we-experiment-on-human-beings/). Who cares, though? [And why not?](http://kottke.org/14/07/why-dont-okcupids-experiments-bother-us)

Talking about data gathering on how people behave - [Disney is tracking guests in their theme parks with RFID bracelets](https://medium.com/re-form/welcome-to-dataland-d8c06a5f3bc6). On the one hand - ugh! - on the other hand: this looks like a pretty interesting data set. It would be pretty cool[^cool] to be able to get access to the data of one's bracelet. Maybe offer an API. Auto checkin people to rides on Swarm.[^swarm]

[^cool]: In the sense of "cool" that people, who do not find it to be cool, call it creepy and a nerdy and a bit sick.

[^swarm]: Swarm. You know. What used to be Foursquare. Remember Foursquare?

Now this is pretty funny - a bunch of drunk students put in a little fake fact into Wikipedia a couple of years ago. Not only did it stay there, it also spread far. Here's what one of them - now a journalist - wrote after she discovered that [her little joke is still alive and well these day](http://www.dailydot.com/lol/amelia-bedelia-wikipedia-hoax/). It also got her banned from Wikipedia.

Have a good one, folks.

I'll be back.
