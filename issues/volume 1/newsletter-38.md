Hello, internet friends!

I have mentioned my <a href="http://dominik.wordpress.com/">new-ish experimental web-log</a> (this is the origin of the word blog, kids!) in Monday's email and I noticed something funny about using wordpress.com as a platform.  

Quick aside: A couple of (internet) years ago, wp.com reacted to the fast rise and hipness of Tumblr and introduced a way to "follow" blogs and see their posts in a reader-like environment. Plus, there are ways to get emails when there are new posts and for notifications. So f someone follows your blog or marks one of your posts as a favorite, there is an email.

Even though I have not linked to or in any way promoted that blog, I suddenly began getting followers and likes. Quite a lot, in fact. I am sure, most of them came through some way of tag-tracking and maybe there is a page for new blogs - I did not really poke around more.  
And while one or two of them were pretty normal bloggers, most of them follow a pretty predictable pattern: Premium users with their own domain, usually selling some kind of marketing book or lifestyle idea. These people are trying to *growth-hack* - which is the most gentle way I can say that they "follow" and "like" mostly to gently nudge people to their own blogs.

I don't mind, really - maybe those people actually do enjoy my links to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/bats-have-sparkly-poop/">sparkly bat poop</a>?

Anyway.

Sparkly bat poop.

Have a nice day,
