Hello, internet friends!

For no apparent reason it is Monday again. Onwards!

The New York Times is [excited about messaging apps](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/technology/why-apps-for-messaging-are-trending.html).  I have been excited about messaging apps since ICQ, which is still around. [Here is me.](http://www.icq.com/people/2468972/)

Big in the 90s and still around now? Marilyn Manson. He has a new album, which means interviews - I liked those in [Esquire](http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/marilyn-manson-interview) and on [Grantland](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/marilyn-manson-the-pale-emperor/).  
And the album itself? Well, I quite like it. But then I was also big in the 90s and happen to be still around.

I have completely no musical skills or talents, but I'd still like to play around with [these little synthesizers](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/22/7868157/teenage-engineering-pocket-operator-synthesizers).

> Sometimes I compare the IRL people in my life with the internet people in my life and I always feel like, why can't the IRL people be more like the internet people?

Obviously I picked that quote to tell you how great *you* are.

Take care, treat yourself to something nice today.
