Hello internet friends!

OMG, no regular Irregularity this week?  
I was busy all day yesterday, got up at 4:30am and didn't got any rest until around 11pm. Such is life. Onwards!

How about some [Rijks Emotions!](http://rijksemotions.com/)

> Rijks Emotions is a student project from Hyper Island, using the Rijksmuseum and Sightcorp api. We're matching people's emotions with their relatives that hang on the museum's walls.

It works pretty well, too:

Now that the computers know me that well it can't take long until they finally take over.

I am quite happy to be 52, though. So the [terrible 40s](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/12/the-real-roots-of-midlife-crisis/382235/) are already behind me and I don't have to look forward to that in my future anymore.

Completely unrelated yet interesting: (I'm too tired for better seques and still too proud for stupid puns. (Not that those would have been allowed in[ this context](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/28/china-media-watchdog-bans-wordplay-puns) anway.))

Did you hear, there will be a new James Bond movie. In their old-school way they opted for unveiling a car and the people in the movie at some event - without even a teaser trailer that silly internet people could link to or embed.

At least Monica Bellucci and Daniel Craig are about the same age, so that's something.

[A brief history of web design for designers](http://blog.froont.com/brief-history-of-web-design-for-designers/) is pretty fun - especially the GIFs.

Let's try to get through this week together.  
You can do it! (And I'll somehow manage to muddle through, somehow.)
