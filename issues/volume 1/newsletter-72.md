Marcel the Shell is voiced by Jenny Slate, who we all know as [Mona-Lisa Saperstein](http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/p8/Drunk-Mona-Lisa-Saperstein,-or-Jean-Ralphios'-sister,-or-Tom's-new-employee-and-girlfriend.jpg) and who has [a strange little origin story for Marcel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VQIsqxCVu0).

Talking about women on TV - I am sure we all wondered what happened to the girl in Journey's "Separate Ways" video? [Well, now we know.](http://noblemania.blogspot.de/2013/07/the-girl-in-video-separate-ways-worlds.html)

Apparently we use [filters on our photos](https://medium.com/backchannel/where-would-instagram-be-without-filters-lost-in-the-uncanny-valley-af59d899fb25) because they would be slightly creepy otherwise? Who knew.

On Saturday I actually managed to leave the house. I got rained on, which [I should have known](https://medium.com/matter/rain-in-exactly-twelve-minutes-b5245dbbb13c), but I didn't.

Stay alive.
