Hello internet friends!

Finally, a typewriter we can all agree on: [Sincerity Machine](http://jesseengland.net/index.php?/project/sincerity-machine-the-comic-sans-typewriter/)


[Three cheers for Pig Pen Sedaris!](http://kottke.org/14/10/three-cheers-for-pig-pen-sedaris) - lovely photo, too.


I know I am late to the party - in fact, *very* late - but I really enjoy SNL. Very much including the title sequence, which has a long and detailed [behind-the-scenes article](http://www.alex-buono.com/how-we-did-it-snl-titles-sequence/) here.


[Why I Feel Bad For - And Understand - The Angry #GamerGate Gamers](http://badassdigest.com/2014/08/31/why-i-feel-bad-for-and-understand-the-angry-gamergate-gamers/) - "An old angry white male nerd looks with sadness at young angry white male nerds." Worth a read. Same author: [Why GamerGate Already Lost](http://badassdigest.com/2014/10/15/why-gamergate-already-lost/)


A series of photos that are relevant to my interests: [Oliver Tjaden's "Keep Flying"](http://www.olivertjaden.de/reportage/keep-flying/).



Wow, at least once I have been way ahead of the curve: [Our children are getting soft. Not just wimpy, or less sharp, but doughy. And pale, too.](http://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/the-kids-are-not-all-right)


I half-listened to [The Incomparable 216](http://5by5.tv/incomparable/216) on the weekend and decided to buy myself "[London Falling](http://www.paulcornell.com/books/novels/london-falling/)" by Paul Cornell. If you like completely strange, dark detective fiction with weird occult stuff, you might like it.

Take care, all of you.
