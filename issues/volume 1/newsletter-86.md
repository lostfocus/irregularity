Hello, internet friends!

Remember when we all[^weall] thought that Google Glass would be the future and that we'll all walk around as glassholes in a Google-controller world, happily searching the web while driving out driverless cars around?  
Well.  
Google Glass is gone and [the story behind it](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/style/why-google-glass-broke.html?_r=0) is pretty amazing.  
It is also rather amazing that this article ended up in the "Style" section of The New York Times and not in the teechnology one. I guess that's another sign that we are clearly living in the future. Or at least *a* future.

[I'll just leave this here.](http://www.theawl.com/2015/02/the-next-internet-is-tv) Thinking too deeply about it will just make me angry. And yes:

> If in five years I’m just watching NFL-endorsed ESPN clips through a syndication deal with a messaging app, and Vice is just an age-skewed Viacom with better audience data, and I’m looking up the same trivia on Genius instead of Wikipedia, and “publications” are just content agencies that solve temporary optimization issues for much larger platforms, what will have been point of the last twenty years of creating things for the web?

Well. Let's hope there will always be a place (and the infrastructure) for [tw: douche speak] independent content creators.

Because what if not? Well: [guns.](http://www.theawl.com/2015/02/the-hollywood-gun-show)

Looking for truely independent content creators[^seriously] with a punk credibility that nobody ever could question? [How about heavy metal musicians in Burma?](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/02/burma-s-heavy-metal-revolution.html)

How about some [brutalist building models](http://www.citylab.com/navigator/2015/02/build-your-own-brutalist-playground-in-paper-cut-outs/385192/) on your desk?

A little bit too on-the-nose, but hey: [Management theories from Roman slave-owners.](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/what-roman-slave-owners-knew-about-managing-staff/)

Remember Sega? Well, I think I have only ever played on a Mega Drive/Genesis once, but [this interview with the product designer behind it](http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/2/3/7952705/sega-genesis-masami-ishikawa) is still very fascinating.
