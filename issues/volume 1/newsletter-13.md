**1.0 Tiny, Tiny Letters**

Hello, new readers! I don't know many of you and that's okay. I am sure you are here because Mr @darth sent you, thank you very much. I'm not going to pretend I have a lot to offer. (FYI: That sentences works about as well as a pick-up line as you might expect.)

I am pretty sure that all those personal (or not so personal) newsletters turning up lately are a bit of a fad, but so far I quite enjoy it. Both as a reader and as a (TW: douche language) content producer.

So, when are you starting one? I'd be happy to hear from you.

**2.0 Monument Valley**

I am probably preaching to the choir, but yes: [Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/) is really [that good.](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/monument-valley-review/)

I don't have more for you today.

Have a nice weekend!
