Hello, internet friends!

I signed up [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/01/08/a-social-network-for-dudes-with-beards-is-kinda-sorta-accidentally-revolutionizing-online-dating/) - the dangers of it [becoming a Tamagotchi](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/online-dating-is-turning-us-all-into-tamagotchis) are [pretty small](https://twitter.com/dominik/status/553257415849037824), though. I mean, after all: [this](https://twitter.com/dominik/statuses/553101670746689537). Onwards!

Always good to know: [What caused Gandhiâ€™s insatiable bloodlust](http://mobile.geek.com/gaming/255118-what-caused-gandhis-insatiable-bloodlust-in-civilization). Well, in the first Civilization game at least.

Talking about numbers that don't add up - here is [Ev Williams' take on website statistics](https://medium.com/@ev/a-mile-wide-an-inch-deep-48f36e48d4cb).  
In case you wonder: I measure "greatness of readers" for this newsletter and the numbers are through the roof. (And now I also raised the kiss-ass metrics, so all is well.)

[How Lego Became The Apple of Toys](http://www.fastcompany.com/3040223/when-it-clicks-it-clicks) - worth reading even with that cringe-worthy title. Can we just stop calling anything the "Apple of X" this year? Or basically the "X of Y"?

Take care, people.
