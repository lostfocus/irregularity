Hello internet friends!

I seem to have settled in that habit of only writing these on mondays - mainly to wake myself up, which seems to work in some way.  
Does this work for you? Or do you really need more email?

It is not even that I have much to say lately, but hey - that didn't stop me before.

So, links!

I quite like Ian Bogost's essay on [Future Ennui](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/future-ennui/380099/?single_page=true) at The Atlantic.

> I’m less interested in accepting wearables given the right technological conditions as I am prospectively exhausted at the idea of dealing with that future’s existence. Just think about it. All those people staring at their watches in the parking structure, in the elevator. Tapping and stroking them, nearly spilling their coffee as they swivel their hands to spin the watch’s tiny crown control.  
	[…]  
	The emergence of a new, laborious media creation and consumption ecosystem built for glancing. The rise of the “glancicle,” which will replace the listicle. The PR emails and the B2B adverts and the business consulting conference promotions all asking, *is your brand glance-aware*?

Timothy B. Lee writes about [Digg and how Betaworks is rebuilding it](http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6154205/how-digg-was-rebuilt-betaworks).  
I personally quite like the new [Digg](http://digg.com/).  (Don't click on it, though. It's where I get most of my links.)

It has been ten years since Lost? Adam Epstein writes for Quartz about [How “Lost” changed the way the world watches TV](http://qz.com/267903/how-lost-changed-the-way-the-world-watches-tv/).

Do you like aviation videos? I do. So here is a [fancy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbJlcKDjTSA) to watch.

Have a good week!
