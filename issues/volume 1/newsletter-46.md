Hello, internet friends!

For no reason I could possibly remember, I watched the Google I/O keynote yesterday.[^reason] It was pretty bad. It started strong-ish, but turned sour pretty fast. The only people who seem to know how the products they were presenting actually worked was some lady engineer and [this dude](http://irregularity.co/46-paleo/brummbrumm/).

[^reason]: Actually, the reason might be the same [reason why football seems to be popular in the US](http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/soccer-seems-huge-but-its-not/) right now - it's a live event with a global watercooler. (Twitter, in case you were wondering. Twitter is the global watercooler.)

Because of *reasons* I am currently ingesting a lot of advice/history how people got to the point they are now a.k.a. famous/successful enough, that I'd know and probably even consume their content. If I understand [the latest episode of Quit!](http://5by5.tv/quit/51)[^quit] correctly, it's mostly showing up, doing the work, and reliably creating value for other people.  
I was sort of hoping it would be not eating pasta or getting up early on the morning or something like that.

[^quit]: Or the show formerly known as Quit!

That's it for this morning. I am spectacularly sleepy and tired - I need my 10 to 12 hours of sleep every night and there is no way I can get that. And by "no way" I mean - I don't get to sleep until noon every day because you better don't start believing it would be a good idea if I went to bed early.[^early]

[^early]: As we have learned before, this is probably also not a way to make me happy and/or successful.
