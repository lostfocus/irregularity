Hello internet friends!

Pretty soon I will write these emails on a [fancy new device.](http://hemingwrite.com/) Lovely, uh?

I'm usually not a big fan of "Oral History" articles - they tend to look too much like lazy copy-and-pasting of old interview quotes. [This one here of Boogie Nights](http://grantland.com/features/boogie-nights/) is pretty interesting to read, though.

[Men who like spicy food are actually more alpha](http://qz.com/312541/men-who-like-spicy-food-are-actually-more-alpha/) - a headline that made me laugh-cry while I was generously applying hot sauce to my lunch.

I used to play Transport Tycoon a lot, back in the days[^openttd] and tended to be pretty proud of huge rail networks. But I doubt it is possible to simulate [trains going from China to Spain](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/14/travel/yixinou-worlds-longest-train-journey/index.html).  
It took about three weeks, that is pretty impressive.

[^openttd]: a couple of weeks ago. Thanks [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/).

Take care people - it's the darkest week of the year for those of us in the northern hemisphere.
