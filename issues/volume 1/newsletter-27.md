*No numbers today. They are silly anyway, should I get rid of them?*

So, yesterday a friend of mine posted the title of a highly fascinating scientific paper to Facebook: "A mobile pet wearable computer and mixed reality system for human–poultry interaction through the internet" - if you want to read it, you can buy it from [Springer](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00779-005-0051-6) or download it from [Researchgate](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220141745_A_mobile_pet_wearable_computer_and_mixed_reality_system_for_human-poultry_interaction_through_the_internet/file/79e41510fc26181fc4.pdf). Or even better, you can [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24SzSL1FI1Q), which has a chicken in a virtual reality suit.

> It increases the poultry pleasure… in a scientific way.

 (If you want to see other cocks experiencing virtual reality, there is always [this blog](http://whiteguyswearinoculusrifts.tumblr.com/).)

I don't think [Werner Herzog would approve](http://vimeo.com/9880377).

Now that we all had a hearty laugh (Hehe, chickens in virtual reality suits are funny!) and suspected it has to be a student prank, let's realize that this research has been done roughly ten years ago and that

> "Poultry Internet" was one of the pioneering works on virtual reality communication between humans and animals.

Says Wikipedia on [Mr Cheok's biography page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_David_Cheok), so it must be right. In fact, reading that bio and following a couple of links, it is obvious that this guy is doing [really important work](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-multi-sensory-internet-brings-smell-taste-and-touch-to-the-web), that will probably influence our perception of reality in the future.  
Plus, it is probably safe to say that once we're completely decked out in internet-connected sensors, ("wearables" ugh) our pets are next. I'm already sure that strapping a cheap Android device with a data plan to a dog might not be such a bad idea - if the dog runs away, as they apparently tend to do, it should be possible to just look at an app with a map and see where they are.

Take care, y'all.
