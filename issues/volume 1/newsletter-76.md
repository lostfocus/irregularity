Hello internet friends!

It's another monday and I am still not over the fact that "Can you forward me that email?" translates to "Print the email and put it on my desk." for some people. Oh well. Onwards.

If someone had told me I'd read a profile about a software engineer on vogue.com that is not a total puff piece, I'd not have believed them.  
Well, here is one: [How Pinterest Engineer Tracy Chou is Breaking the Silicon Ceiling](http://www.vogue.com/4537369/pinterest-tracy-chou-silicon-valley/). 

Talking about professions in magazines that I would not have thought to be possible, here is an article in the New Yorker on [The Rise of the Professional Cyber Athlete](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/good-game).  
After reading the article you might actually want to watch [that Bomber vs Scarlett match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIygo3bIVmo) - it's a thing of beauty.

A very different thing of beauty is the idea and execution behind this gallery: [24 Photographs Taken  at the Exact Same Moment  All Around the World](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/time-zone-photos/).

[This](http://youtu.be/e7UIJp0FKZQ) is a very fast train. And it's maybe a bit less disappointing than the Shanghai Maglev that even at full speed feels a bit like a metro. (Which is probably by design - it is how it is used, anyway.)

Have a good start into the week.
