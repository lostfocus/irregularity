[Secret](https://www.secret.ly/) finally reached Germany and the first evening was huge fun. Complete with backchannel chatter about who might be behind which message.  
If you care to join me and the other secret-havers: my email address is dschwind@lostfocus.de - you might want to add me to your address book before you join up. (Yes, they use the address book to connect people, which is a bit iffy.)

# 2.0 MetaFilter

I am still bummed out about the MetaFilter story. Here is Matt Haughey on the [Future of MetaFilter](https://medium.com/technology-musings/941d15ec96f0). It's all rather sad.
