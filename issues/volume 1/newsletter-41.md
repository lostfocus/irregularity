Hello, internet friends!

Today I learned that when you folks send me a nice reply to these emails and insert some nice attachment, (maybe a GIF of a baby hippo?) these files will be removed for some reason. So… I don't even know if it was a GIF of a baby hippo.  
Please send me GIFs of baby hippos.

Plazes, Brightkite, Gowalla, Dopplr… FourSquare?  

I am a big fan of these check-in and "hello, here I am" services. But ever since FourSquare changed into Swarm, it just leaves me cold. And mostly because it usually looks like this:

Uhm, yeah. Even though I use it more for myself, this is a bit depressing.

Also, I miss the game aspects of the whole thing. Why would I want to check-in if I can't be the mayor of something? Or get (completely meaningless) points in exchange for my location data?  
And why can't I be "off the grid" anymore?

Gah, FourSquare. Seriously.

It also doesn't help that it is highly unlikely that I have working mobile internet at any point here.

Erm, sorry. I am being a bit negative here - of course everything is great, the sun is shining, it's warm and lovely outside.  
Now where are my GIFs of baby hippos? **Don't** reply to this email to send them to me. Unless it's just links to them, I guess.

Have a nice weekend!
