**1.0 Coffee!**
 
Still slightly fired up from being angry about being angry - good day to you all, wherever you may roam. This is the first picture of that silly challenge:

So, Facebook bought Oculus.
 
For those who didn't follow the story so far: (I know I didn't, because I'm not much of a gamer. So if I get anything wrong, please let me know - just reply to the email.) Oculus is a Kickstarter-funded Start-Up that works on a Virtual Reality headset called Oculus Rift. A lot of indie developers jumped on the idea of an independently financed VR headset and began creating (or porting) games over.
 
Now that Facebook bought Oculus for a bucketload of money, many people of course feel slighted, mostly for two reason:
 
1. People don't trust Facebook.
1. Once again the evils of capitalism crushed an indie dream of collaborative creation and cooperation. This is very much the stronger point here. None of the people who gave money to Oculus through Kickstarter is getting any money back. (As far as I know.) And all of those smaller indie software companies, that thought they'd grow together with an indie hardware company to shape the future of gaming and virtual reality, do now have to deal with a huge, mostly anonymous entity. I guess if they want that, they can just go back to developing for Sony and Microsoft hardware. And as someone who had contact with Instagram developer relations people before the Facebook deal and after, let me tell you one thing: it does make a huge difference.
 
Just read the [blog post by Markus Persson](http://notch.net/2014/03/virtual-reality-is-going-to-change-the-world/), the guy who gave the world Minecraft.
