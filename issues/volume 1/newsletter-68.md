Hello internet friends!

So, [what's the deal](http://mentalfloss.com/article/59044/whats-deal-whats-deal-did-seinfeld-actually-say-it) with [Ello](http://ello.co)? 

By now we know it's some sort of new social network (getting excited about those seems to be so 2004) with [some issues](https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/oy73kFfDdhOPh8Jv9z9pFA).

What do we want?

We want a free, ad-free, un-tracked, archived social network with privacy controls, outside of the sphere of influence of governments (except when that leads to behaviour we don't condone. Can't *they* do something about *that*?) and corporations. We want [our own blog](https://twitter.com/anotherny/status/515564673782276096), de-centralized but simple.
And surely not self-hosted, [ugh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)).

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

(And who are "we"?)

Did you watch [the Black-ish pilot](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/09/24/the-creator-of-black-ish-on-his-new-show-stereotypes-and-cosby/)? No? You might want to look into that, it's [a funny show](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/black-ish-pilot-209666). Certainly funnier than [this weekend's SNL](http://fanfare.metafilter.com/948/Saturday-Night-Live-Chris-Pratt-and-Ariana-Grande).

[Empty cities are inherently creepy.](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3035446/eerie-video-shows-masdar-city-the-sustainable-city-of-the-future-has-no-one-in-it) At least this one has self-driving people-pods in them.

If you have 56 minutes, you can spend them in worse ways than listening to/watching [this talk by Merlin Mann about Advanced Tricycling](http://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8). (You know it's a metaphor. It is really about how we learn stuff and how to know what we need to learn.)

◔̯◔

Tinder, [ugh](https://medium.com/matter/how-swipe-culture-is-tinderizing-our-lives-50bd8b16131e). AirBNB, [ugh](http://nymag.com/news/features/airbnb-in-new-york-debate-2014-9/). Instagram, [ugh](http://www.dailydot.com/technology/hyperlapse-selfies/).

Oh well. At least [this](http://www.bonernoise.com/) might be useful.
