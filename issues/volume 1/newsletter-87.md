Hello, internet friends!

Every time I hear "Minority Report"-technology I think it's about a silly hand-wavy interface. [But then there is this now.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/02/11/predpol-predictive-policing/)  
Onwardsâ€¦?

I can see a future where a police might predict that [a Twitter bot](http://fusion.net/story/47353/twitter-bot-death-threat/) might not be a threat. But maybe it is not that easy? Some of your favourite Twitter accounts might be bots already. 

And if they are bots, what happens, when they tweet something stupid? After all, the guy who ran that bot that scared the police, shut it down afterwards.  
Luckily we're still not that heartless when humans write something dumb, [but we might be getting close.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html)

When bots are not writing tweets for their programmers, they are [playing the dating game](http://crockpotveggies.com/2015/02/09/automating-tinder-with-eigenfaces.html) for them.

What a future we live in.
