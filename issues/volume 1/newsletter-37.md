Hello, internet friends![^internet]

I am back again after a four day hiking weekend.

If I do that again - go to a weird and foreign country, especially with some time to waste in between activities, I now know not to think that "eh, those couple of MB of roaming data will be enough, right? Just the fact that I had to actively think of how much data I was spending made me grumpy at times.  
Also: podcasts are huge beasts. Just downloading that one episode of IRLTalk would have easily cost me twice what the roaming would have given me.

Anyway, let's get on with the show. I came home to about three thousand unread feed items, not quite as many unread emails and the nagging feeling that I missed a whole bunch of half-day micro internet scandals.

So, interesting links I have seen so far while playing catch-up:

[Upcoming.org is coming back!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg/posts) This is, as they say, good news. The articles on [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/29/5758354/the-brilliant-life-stupid-death-and-improbable-return-of-upcoming-org) and [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/29/surviving-yahoo-upcoming/) are worth reading, too. So is probably the [CMD+Space interview](http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/98), but I did not listen to it, yet.

[This is kind of depressing.](http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/05/shipped-to-california.html) So why not listen to Chris Gethard how to [overcome your programming and become a better man](http://thechrisgethardshow.tumblr.com/post/87041806996/overcome-your-programming-and-be-a-better-man)? If that's not helping, how about [Your Princess Is in Another Castle: Misogyny, Entitlement, and Nerds](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/27/your-princess-is-in-another-castle-misogyny-entitlement-and-nerds.html)? Yeah, I'm learning a lot, lately.

In nerdier news(?) - I am tempted to build my own version of Jeremy Keith's [POSSE implementation](http://adactio.com/journal/6826/). (You can click this link even if you have no clue, what a POSSE is - I don't, really, but it seems doable.) Having an input field on top of a web page is really a "game changer" (ugh.) and  I have been experimenting with that a bit over on [my wordpress.com blog](http://dominik.wordpress.com/).

Thanks for reading, survive your monday!
