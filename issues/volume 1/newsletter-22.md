# 1.0 Artisanal ugh

Sometimes I tweet "[Ugh.](https://twitter.com/dominik/status/459551972925120512)" with a grumpy emoji in the morning. It's what I want to say *every* morning, but I tend to forget.  
For a while I did it so often and so regularly, that people asked me if it is automated. But indeed it is not - every morning you might or might not get an artisanal, made-for-the-occassion "Ugh." from me.

Because automated tweets are silly.  
As I realized again last night. For the last couple of days I had an IFTTT set up to ask the fine folks who follow me on twitter: ["Did I miss something?"](https://twitter.com/dominik/status/459425844344422401)  
I was hoping for good and/or funny answers, but mostly I got "no"s - which can't obviously be true, because I miss a lot of stuff all the time. So I switched that recipe off again - it has been annoying lately.

Maybe it's not so bad to be poor then? That hammock looks good to me.  
On the other hand,[ being a poor German is actually wreaking havoc on the whole of Europe](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/how-underpaid-german-workers-helped-cause-europes-debt-crisis.html
), so maybe not.

So Ridley Scott liked Prometheus so much, he's going to turn [it into a TV series?](http://www.avclub.com/article/hbo-developing-ridley-scott-series-about-ancient-a-203769)

I'm sleepy. It's weekend.

Have a nice one!
