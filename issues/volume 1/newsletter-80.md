Hello internet friends!

A happy new year to all of you, may things be great for you and those you care about! (And slightly inconvenient for those, who you secretly wish ill upon.)

I wanted to round up this very short list of 2014 reviews with "2014 in goats" because obviously goats where the big winner of our hearts. But either the internet let me down or my googling skills are deteriorating faster than I want.  
So no goats for you, sorry.

Be safe and brace yourself: once the whole holiday and new year ordeal is over, you'll get these email in a more regular irregular pattern again.  
Thanks for reading, I enjoy writing these. And say hi if you want.
