# 1.0 Comme des fous
If you have looked at the archive of these emails over on [irregularity.co](http://irregularity.co/) you might have noticed something that I didn't do in the mail client, yet: I picked some rather interesting pictures from the [Flickr Commons](https://www.flickr.com/commons) to go with each mail. And I have to say, I quite like the effect so far - it makes the archives rather pretty.  
That's why I am rather disheartened to see that the Brooklyn Museum [decided to delete](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/2014/04/04/social-change/) all their content from the Commons when leaving - instead of letting it sit there for people to enjoy.
I mean, sure: they moved them over to the [Wikimedia Commons](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Brooklyn_Museum_Flickr_stream), which is nice, too. I still don't understand why it was necessary to delete the whole account from Flickr - and I am not the only one [who is concerned](http://adactio.com/journal/6739/):

> Leaving Flickr Commons could have been the perfect opportunity to invest in long-term self-hosting. Instead theyâ€™re abandoning the Titanic by hitching a ride on the Hindenberg.

Well, we'll see.
#2.0 Links!
*That worked fine the last time, so here we go:*
## 2.1 Energize!
Here is a [good guide on how to save a bunch of energy on your iPhone](http://www.overthought.org/blog/2014/the-ultimate-guide-to-solving-ios-battery-drain). Worst offender apparently: Facebook.
## 2.2 Neeeeerds!
So, yes, I really liked the "Silicon Valley" pilote. A few interesting articles about it: ['Silicon Valley' Skewers the Empty Utopianism of the Tech Industry](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/silicon-valley-skewers-the-hollow-utopianism-of-tech-culture) basically says that making fun of Silicon Valley is like shooting fish in a barrel. NPR basically thinks the same: [What Silicon Valley's Cast Thinks About Silicon Valley Culture](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/03/24/293913606/what-silicon-valleys-cast-thinks-about-silicon-valley-culture?ft=1&f=1048):

> Socially awkward people with money is a very funny area.

## 2.3 Sour! Sour?
If you like watching a video of babies being not very happy at all, [today is your lucky day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q5mgtUOI_w).
## 2.4 Sans
Of course I sent [Comic Neue](http://comicneue.com/) to all the teachers in my immediate family.

# 4.0 Procrastination
Is it very obvious that I should be doing something else?

Have a good day!
