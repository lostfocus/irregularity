*Hello new readers! You are quite a lot since the last email, which of course puts a lot of pressure on me to welcome you properly.*

*Let me see what I have for you.*

# 1.0 Nerd-stuff!

Yes, it's mostly nerd stuff today, sorry. I was on the road more or less all day and when I came back, I was too busy, re-watching [that video of The Prodigy at Milton Keynes](http://vimeo.com/56824028) and [google image searching Rinko Kikuchi](https://www.google.com/search?q=rinko+kikuchi&source=lnms&tbm=isch).  
You see, important work.

## 1.1 Check out

As someone who liked the whole location-based check-in silliness since Plazes was around, I am slightly wary of what Foursquare might be doing with [their new Swarm app](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5666062/foursquare-swarm-new-app).  
I was always doing that as a purely solipsistic endeavour - I never cared where my friends checked in and I couldn't care less if they know where I am, most of the time.  
So, uhm, do I have to build my own check-in-thing now? I have something half-finished somewhere in a backup.

## 1.2 URL

Apparently there is a beta version of Google Chrome around that [hides the URL of a website](http://www.allenpike.com/2014/burying-the-url/) in favour of a Google search box.  
Does that mean I have to change browsers now? URLs are the glue of the web, without them it's just text and a bunch of images and a whole lot of porn.

## 1.3 Just a box

Apparently there are now a few startups that want to be "Dropbox for physical objects" - one of them just got a cool 8 Million $$$.  
For a box.  
To be honest, they also send some underpaid dude over to your place to pick up the box and take it… who knows where. Honestly, with the garbage fees being as high as they are over here, I might actually be willing to pay a startup money to pick up my stuff and put it somewhere where I can forget about it.  
I just hope they don't return it if I stop paying.

# 2.0 No 2 today

Actually that's all there is today. I played Civilization all evening and will be at the WordCamp in Zürich all weekend.

Take care y'all.
