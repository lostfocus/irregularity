Hello, internet friends.

I had a long, rambling email for you today, but [Martin](https://twitter.com/schneyra) looked over it and said it might be a bit too dark. So… nothing for you today.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Okay, maybe a little bit - how about some baby animals?

Have a wonderful, lovely weekend, you good people.
