2014: [An enormous bitcoin mine went up in flames](http://qz.com/293418/an-enormous-bitcoin-mine-went-up-in-flames-affecting-the-entire-network/).  
Is this the future? It sounds *enormously* cyberpunk-y to me.

Talking about *enormously* cyberpink-y things - my copy of [City of Darkness](http://cityofdarkness.co.uk/) arrived this weekend. A stunningly well-made book about [Kowloon Walled City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City) I will probably be busy looking at the great photos and diagrams and reading about the inhabitant's lives for quite some while.  
And yes, one of [these cross-sections](http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2014/10/28/detailed-cross-section-of-the-kowloon-walled-city-created-by-japanese-researchers/) made it into the book as well.

The big podcast du jour is [The Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) which chronicles a reporter looking into a murder case from 1999. Apparently it is very well made and yet - I am not all that willing to give it a listen. Mostly because I am afraid I might like it too much and then forget that these are real people and not something like Lost or Twin Peaks.  
[Obviously I am not the only one with those ideas.](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/is-it-wrong-to-be-hooked-on-serial/382500/) Especially since [some listeners seem to start looking into the case by themselves.](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/07/serial-listeners-detectives-troubling-results)

And hey, sure, why not? [Cooking 101: An Infographic is worth a thousand recipes.](http://www.metafilter.com/144308/Cooking-101-An-Infographic-is-worth-a-thousand-recipes)

Be safe.
