# 1.0 Say what?

Current status: Hate-watching [Avril Lavigne's "Hello Kitty" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgszo2XTklk).

# 2.0 Pointy Boots Update!

On the topic of music: [3BallMTY has a new album](http://open.spotify.com/album/7qehoKXpz09hRtTi8V0hWm).

# 3.0 Move.

I was told that I'll probably die alone and unloved if I don't start doing sports and I am not one to take these threats lightly. So for the first time in many, many years I decided to actually move more than just walk from the couch to the fridge and back.

Maybe I should have picked something with smaller elevation changes because even though I managed to have a medium speed that is slower than my usual walking speed, everything hurts today. ("Everything" is in "I die!" when I have a light fever.) Yes, after less than 2.5kms.  

Maybe being alone and unloved is not so bad after all.

I did sign up for one of the training sessions over at Runkeeper, though, so who knows. Maybe soon I will be able to run as fast as I walk.

# 4.0 A friendly warning

I am working on a longer, probably pretty angry, piece of writing on [chrononormativism](https://lostfocus.de/chrononomativism/) - a word I conveniently made up a couple of years ago. Probably triggered by [Nico's blog post about how he rises early now and his life has improved](http://lumma.de/2014/04/18/die-sache-mit-dem-fruehaufstehen/) (It's in German, but my tl;dr basically said everything.) (It's also only a sign that he is getting older, but we'll get there.) and by the fact that I am currently in a social situation where many people think that getting up later than six is an act auf debauchery. And a clear sign that the [decline of the west](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West) is further along that we'd all care to admit.

I'll have a coffee now, I hope you all manage to do something nice for yourselves, too.
