Hello internet friends!

It's 2014, that poor little probe we landed on a comet is already out of juice. A bit like my iPhone around lunchtime.  
Talking about probes: at least [Uranus might be full of surprises](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/11/14/uranus-might-be-full-of-surprises/).

Last week I mentioned *Serial* and how I wouldn't listen to it because reasons. Well, those of you who know me might have guessed it: I had to give it a try anyway. I'm still not too sure what to make of it - from what I have heard in my binge-listening-and-then-unsubscribing this weekend, it seems to me the guy did it and now a whole bunch of people who were hoping to put this behind them are in the internet's spotlight.  
*Serial* is a big hit, though - and [suddenly people like podcasts](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/whats-behind-the-great-podcast-renaissance.html).  
[Suddenly?](http://www.marco.org/2014/11/16/why-podcasts-are-suddenly-back)

Besides listening to podcasts my weekend was eaten away by [0h h1](http://0hh1.com/). Curse you, addictive browser logic game!

Oh, wait, no - back to podcasts. (Sorry.)  
The wonderful [Allie Brosh](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/) was on Marc Maron's WTF Podcast - it is [a great interview](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_550_-_allie_brosh) and oh boy, does it get dark.

Too dark for you? How about some [knowledge about the weird reproductive cycle of jellyfish](http://qz.com/290657/jellyfish-are-stepping-up-their-ocean-invasions-and-humans-are-helping-them/) and how they'll soon take over the world?  
Or you know - [space sloths](http://www.theverge.com/tldr/2014/11/10/7171345/the-best-use-for-apple-airdrop-is-space-sloths).

Be safe.
