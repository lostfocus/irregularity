Hello, internet friends!

Sometimes, when I am bored or when I like to watch things packed neatly, I watch those [videos where people pack clothes "for weeks" in a carry-on luggage.](http://nerdytourist.com/en/2014/05/26/packing/) This is always pretty amazing and of course they manage to fit so many things in these convenient backpacks or trolleys.  
I just wonder - don't these people smell?  
Maybe I am overdoing it, but I tend to change my underwear and my t-shirt daily. So just a week-long trip means filling up any kind of luggage with seven of each of those, which will take up quite some space, no matter how well I fold and stuff and compress my clothes.

In a bit unrelated thoughts - remember when [I tried to order something online from a small-ish webshop and it was a bit of an ordeal](http://irregularity.co/4-shocking/)?  
Turns out - that seems to be a repeating pattern. And maybe it's a repeating pattern because Amazon has messed so badly with my brain with their hyper-optimized logistics. By now I have been trained to think of "online shopping" as something immediate: I order something today and if I don't get it the day after tomorrow, something *must* be broken.  
This is not the norm and it's certainly not something most companies can offer and even less so when it's on scale - I doubt most of these small to medium sized companies have the capacity to react if there is a sudden high demand on their goods. Ah, well - I'll cut them some slack - the small ones. But if your company was a mail order business even *before* the internet, you better get good.

I'll probably have nothing to say tomorrow, so: have a nice weekend! Go hug a tree or whatever it is you guys do with your spare time.
