Hello internet friends!

[This weekend I flooded my kitchen with coffee.](https://lostfocus.de/fuck-the-aeropress/)

I also finished reading William Gibson's new book "[The Peripheral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peripheral)" and it is unsurprisingly very good.  
I always thought that it is unneccesary to tell people about him and his work, but "What's a William Gibson book? Is that like Harry Potter?" made me rethink that.  
*Turns out*, William Gibson is already here, he's just not very evenly distributed.

Of course a new William Gibson book also means a lot of William Gibson interviews. Here are some I enjoyed: (Warning, some are quite spoilery)

* [The First Sentence Is a Handshake](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/william-gibson-by-heart/382027/) 
* [William Gibson interview: time travel, virtual reality, and his new book](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7083625/william-gibson-interview-time-travel-virtual-reality-and-the-peripheral)
* [William Gibson riffs on writing and the future](http://ideas.ted.com/2014/10/27/william-gibson-riffs-on-writing-and-the-future/)

And then there is [this long portrait of Mr Gibson.](http://www.gq.com/entertainment/books/201411/william-gibson?printable=true)

That should keep you busy for a while - if you're not that interested, here, have a sleeping puppy:

Or [the best wombat movie ever made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuQ_rVM-WE).

Or some [Japanese rock music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oncPGYO5g5M).

Be safe.
