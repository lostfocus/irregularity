Hi! *Hello!* Hello, you!  
You, yes, you. Dear, lovely newsletter reader.

I forgot to take my meds this morning, so this is going to be *fun*.

Maciej Cegłowski gave a talk at a conference in Düsseldorf last week, which works great as an essay, too: [The Internet With A Human Face](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm).

Talking about faces that are not quite human: Google has [their own self-driving car](http://recode.net/2014/05/27/googles-new-self-driving-car-ditches-the-steering-wheel/) now. It looks like the cartoon version of a Smart and will probably hunt down and destroy all of us some day. But hey:

> To head off any concerns of malfunctioning robots hurtling you toward imminent doom, Google has made the car look cute and cuddly from the outset.

Yepp, that's going to help.

Ugh, writing on Medium. What a [sell-out](https://medium.com/message/3450a5bc98d2).

I'll be in a weird foreign country the next couple of days, one that I never stepped foot in before, with a strange, incomprehensible language and probably no internet.[^nointernet]

[Peace out](http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/article/3901/your-email-sign-off-decoded/)[^peace]

[^nointernet]: Nah, just kidding. There's always roaming. And yes, I know - a prepaid SIM card might be cheaper, but not necessarily so. It's only four days and as far as I can figure, they have the same public holiday as we have tomorrow, so acquiring one of those might be a bit of a hassle. I also don't really plan to return to that country all that soon again.

[^peace]: Where's "[Toodles](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=toodles&defid=6959686)" on this list?
