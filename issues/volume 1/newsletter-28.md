# 1.0 Follow-Up
Remember [26: Infinite Improbability](http://irregularity.co/26-infinite-improbability/)? Well, imagine my joy/horror when Jason Seifer started to quote and comment on it in the [latest episode of IRL Talk](http://www.irltalk.com/episodes/episode-25-a-criminal-in-a-pink-yolo-hat).  

# 2.0 Waves of Addiction

> Just one more roundâ€¦

I don't know how and why it happened, but Civilization got me again. Instead of doing something useful, I was playing Civ V all weekend. Again.

And then there is going to be a new one soon, which is exciting - I mean, just [look at that trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtYWqE55s24)!

# 3.0 Apps!

I just bought two iPhone apps just because they were in the [Mac Power Users shownotes](http://5by5.tv/mpu/192):

* [Unread](http://jaredsinclair.com/unread/)
* [Habit List](http://habitlist.com/)

I haven't listened to the episode, yet and I just looked around the apps a bit - they both seem pretty and they seem to be doing something well that I'd want them to do.

As usual: take care, people.
