Hello internet friends!

Another monday, another week.

> Chongqing City has set up China's 1st "exclusive sidewalk for mobile phone users ” to avoid possible crashes.

[This is a great idea.](https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/510611759129174016) It's also a very 2014 idea.

> Apple ‘gifting’ each user with a U2 album downloaded into iTunes. At least one of my friends reported that he had wireless synching of his phone disabled; Apple overrode his express preferences in order to add the album to his music collection. The expected 'surprise and delight' was really more like 'surprise and delete'. I suspect that the strong negative response (in some quarters, at least) had less to do with a dislike of U2 and everything to do with the album as a metonym for this widespread culture of nonconsensual behaviour in technology.
