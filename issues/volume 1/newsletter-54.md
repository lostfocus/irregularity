Hello, internet friends!

As someone who has the tendency to acquire a dangerous amount of superficial knowledge about topics that interest me - often sprinkled with useless, but fun facts - I tend to be baffled by the amount of people who use stuff and have not a single interest in how they work.  
Which is something that is fine when it comes to things like, uh, a toaster oven or a dish washing machine, but even though I should know better, I am constantly surprised how little people know about the networked tools that they use for both job and leisure every day. And I am not talking about some kind of smart home automation things, it's rather basic things like email. Or which password to use where.  

Maybe things are too complicated? Maybe it is not immediately obvious, that your router and your email provider and Facebook are different entities. Maybe IMAP is really too hard to understand and the fact, that an email is gone on "the computer" after it has been deleted on the phone is really weird and troubling. I don't know.

So maybe we shouldn't urge people to learn how to code. It might be a better idea to make people understand how their soft- and hardware works. Things  that they use everyday and that they will have to use rather more than less in the future.

Well, next email will be more links.

Have a good one!
