# 1.0 The Beard

Let me tell you a little secret: that thing starts to annoy me. But it is part of an important(!) experiment. I made that pact with myself: if nobody mentions the beard all week, I will shave it off on Sunday.  
I usually know on Monday that I will keep it for at least another week.

Because I am slightly annoyed, I thought I made it easier for Team No-Beard: I will shave it off on Sunday if I don't hear a "He, he, you look like one of those taliban!"-"jokes."  
Now I usually know by Tuesday.

# 2.0 The Internet

It might be no surprise that I *really* like the internet. On some days, it really delivers, though. I give you: yesterday evening! (If you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominik), you have probably seen most of it already.)

[Deep Sea Fauna](http://deepseafauna.tumblr.com/)… With Googly Eyes. [Vous êtes des pros](http://youtu.be/BWnwl_AC2ew). [PornBurger](http://pornburger.me/). [Trick Global](http://youtu.be/hBduDuYXJHI). (Yes, two videos by the same group of people. So what.) Nobody likes [the president of France](http://fuckyeahdementia.com/post/85747590069/tastefullyoffensive-the-president-of-france). Not played, yet, but I like the idea: [Make it rain - The Love of Money](http://makeitraintheloveofmoney.com/).

Tonight I'll go to see [Stromae](http://youtu.be/UmF1B518VUw) live, so that should be good.

Take care, y'all.
