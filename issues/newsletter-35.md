*It helps immensly to listen to [this weird remix of 90s hits as trap music](https://soundcloud.com/djsoloisawesome/trapped-in-the-90s-trapped-out). I am not sure what it helps **with**, but it does help.*

Today the internet (and by internet, I mean Twitter) exploded in [\#YesAllWomen](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YesAllWomen). #YesAllWomen? [An explainer.](http://ginadenny.blogspot.com/2014/05/yesallwomen.html) At the same time, my Secret feed filled up with a whole bunch of "Mimimi, I can't get a date." messages. I can't even.

Talking about not even being able to can anymore: I actually managed to read two whole sentences of the MRA-type Santa Barbara shooter. What a mess. The best discussion about the whole situation is (where else?) over on [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/139355/I-wish-girls-were-attracted-to-me-I-dont-know-why-they-arent).

Speaking of MetaFilter (Yes, again. Sorry.) - there is now a [fundraiser](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/23250/MetaFilter-Fundraising) going on. It's actually pretty interesting to see who else linked and tweeted about that, very often people I would not have taken as the typical MeFi reader.

I'd pretty much prefer if the MeFi-people would not [pester](http://www.metafilter.com/139305/The-Mother-of-All-Self-Links#5553860) [Caitlin Dewey](https://twitter.com/caitlindewey). She writes [a pretty good newsletter that I enjoy a lot](http://www.tinyletter.com/cdewey). That being said, "hapless gibbering app-fondling touchscreen cretin" is a [pretty funny insult](http://www.metafilter.com/139305/The-Mother-of-All-Self-Links#5553765). Of course I immediately had to immediately turn into [my twitter bio](https://twitter.com/dominiksbio/status/469749582440591362).

In news that probably surprise nobody: people are taking [selfies during the coup in Thailand](https://news.vice.com/article/the-complex-consequences-of-thai-coup-selfies). Because honestly - who wouldn't?

And finally, here are some [ducklings trying to climb stairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHy6bBKu0j4).

Be nice.
