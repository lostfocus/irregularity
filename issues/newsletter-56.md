Hello internet friends!

Have you seen '[Lucy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/)' yet?  
I haven't but when I will, at some point, I won't be able to not see it through [this lens](http://hellomollyo.tumblr.com/post/92751529027/things-that-didnt-make-it-into-this-my-review).

> Those who hit the paths for 150 minutes or more a week, or who were particularly speedy, clipping off six-minute miles or better, lived longer than those who didn’t run. But they didn’t live significantly longer those who ran the least, including [people running as little as five or 10 minutes a day](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/running-just-5-minutes-a-day-has-long-lasting-benefits/) at a leisurely pace of 10 minutes a mile or slower.

I'm not even all that sure if "living longer" should really be the goal, to be honest.

I am quite tempted to get one of those quadcopters with a camera. [Posts like this are not helping.](http://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-drones-quadcopters/)

> I want to believe everyone’s motives are pure, even though I honestly don’t even know that about my own motives.  
I want to believe that I can have absolute confidence that neither I nor any other people around me are horrible. Cards Against Humanity is built on that wishful thinking.

I have honestly given up on that, which is freeing in its own way.

Have a good day, folks.
