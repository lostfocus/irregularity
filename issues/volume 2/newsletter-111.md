Hello internet friends!

I had some dodgy red wine yesterday, walked around in the sun and my current reality is *very* different from the one I usually experience. There is this sudden hum and pushing myself through the air is a bit harder than usual, too.

Am I the only one who didn't notice the dog on [Marc Zuckerberg's pregnancy announcement post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102276573729791)? For quite a while I thought that this is quite a weirdly fluffy dress.

I ordered four things from Amazon this weekend. I had those build up over a few days, so I could order them all at the same time, so just one package will need to be sent out.  
This morning I got four shipping notices - each item separately, shipped on different days with different couriers. This is all getting a bit silly.

Talking about silly - [VidCon 2015](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/07/vidcon-2015). Did nobody tell people that making teen boys - who are the worst, I know, I was one - famous is [a **terrible** idea](http://www.theawl.com/2015/07/the-fuckbois-of-vine)?

I've never been to Reykjavik, but [this map](http://www.reykjavikcentermap.com/) is very, very pretty.

Be safe.
