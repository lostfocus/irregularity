Hello internet friends!

> Dick is abundant and low value.

Glad we cleared [that](https://medium.com/matter/the-dickonomics-of-tinder-b14956c0c2c7) up.  
Did this email even reach you or was this enough "strong language" to walk right into the spam filters?

[Instant Rap Airhorn](http://www.instantrapairhorn.com/) is something that exists and I am sure you can find useful ways to incorporate it into your life.

Maybe to lighten up the mood while your place drops out of the sky [because the software just shuts down](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/01/us-aviation-authority-boeing-787-dreamliner-bug-could-cause-loss-of-control)? Your fellow flyers will surely appreciate that lovely gesture.

I am weirdly proud of being a nag-hipster - I told Dominik about the weirdness of [the Mercator projection on his wall](http://www.dominik-schwarz.net/potpourri/worldmap/) way before *everybody* on the internet did.  
The reason is obviously the same: it's an awesome idea, a great execution and we're all silently angry at ourselves that we don't have the passion and patience to put that much energy and time into something that cool. The projection complaint is just a smoke bomb. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Now is ze time on *Sprockets* vhen ve dance!

Have some fruit, take a nap. And why not let me know how you're doing - any news on your side?
