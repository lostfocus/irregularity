Hello internet friends,

so, we got through another one of *those* again. I hope you had a nice one.  
Onwards!

I'm quite a big fan of [Muji](http://www.muji.com/). Almost every time I was in town in Düsseldorf I made sure I at least looked at their window display, it is just always very pleasing. (These days the closest Muji is in Paris, which seems a bit excessive, trip-wise, just for some window shopping.)  

> Muji, with its lack of logos, represents post-cool, normcore Japan, which is, of course, a fetishized version of Japanese culture—serene and neat and proper.

*Turns out* Muji is growing pretty fast, [trying to stay calm while taking over the world.](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-commercial-zen-of-muji)

I use Spotify's "Discover Weekly" playlist on my Sonos as alarm clock and let me tell you: it's not always "[so damn good](http://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/)."  
But it is pretty good often enough, so I'll probably keep doing that.

[Erm.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/nosy-apple-watch-users-discover-another-way-to-go-hands-free-1451077454)  
And by "erm" I probably mean "same." How else am I supposed to use the watch when my right hand is busy <del>fondling</del> <ins>using</ins> the phone?

If you just want to write something on the internet [without much hassle](https://medium.com/swlh/the-truth-about-blogging-f7ada34e6121) you can probably do worse than medium dot com. I quite like it, too - it's nice as a platform and there are a lot of things the people there do right. But when[ the founder says that "we" basically only need Facebook and Medium](http://recode.net/2015/12/24/mediums-ev-williams-its-going-to-make-less-and-less-sense-to-publish-on-the-web/), he might [not be all that right](http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/24/0703.html).  
I'll still re-publish all these emails [over there](https://medium.com/irregular-archive) - but, well, no. The web will still be happily being published on when Medium is long gone and forgotten.

If you want to read a bit more, here we go:

* [Gunther, Christine and Otto](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2014/newsspec_8703/index.html) - a nice BBC special on the couple that drove all around the world in their Mercedes G.
* [Your Smartphone Camera Should Suck. Here's Why It Doesn't](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/smartphone-camera-sensors/) - fascinating.
* [Every Tumblr meme from 2015, in one insane timeline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/18/an-insane-timeline-of-2015-in-tumblr-memes/) - I can't even.

That was it for 2015, see you all next year.
