Hello, internet friends!

I know it is Tuesday, but here we go. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

[Someone famous wrote something about not being famous](https://medium.com/message/nobody-famous-37790cb4d014) but having the  number of Twitter follower someone famous might have.  
Well, okay.

Even though the reviews for the Apple watch are not overly positive - [here is the best one, as far as I can tell](https://medium.com/technology-musings/my-rocky-first-24hrs-with-the-%E1%B4%A1%E1%B4%80%E1%B4%9B%E1%B4%84%CA%9C-67c841702a70) - gadget envy is slowly growing within me.  
Damnit.

This scrappy little email to my internet friends made it to the [The Ultimate (Unofficial) TinyLetter Directory](http://shauntellehamlett.com/tinyletter-directory/) - in the category "Assorted Amusing Things" which is perfectly fine for me. Knowing about this directory is a bit scary, though - so many interesting tinyletters to subscribe to…  
(When does Google Inbox finally have a category for these kind of emails?)

I pretty much ignored what happened to [the poor eggplant emoji](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/04/eggplant_rising_how_the_purple_fruit_surpassed_the_banana_as_the_most_phallic.html) but now [even Instagram](http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/free-the-eggplant-emoji-instagram#.trmJEBDBnR) hides it in their search:

> [… ]the eggplant emoji is indeed blocked from search because it consistently is used for content that violates their community guidelines.

Well okay.

Take a nap sometimes, you've earned it.
