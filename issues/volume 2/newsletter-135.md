Bet you didn't see this coming:

> Betting worth billions. Elite players. Violent threats. Covert messages with Sicilian gamblers. And suspicious matches at Wimbledon. [Leaked files expose match-fixing evidence](http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket) that tennis authorities have kept secret for years.

Besides the story itself I find it pretty fascinating to see the BBC work with Buzzfeed on this one.

Sometimes - <abbr title="to be honest">tbh</abbr> all the time - computers are acting up and even those of us who know a bit about these things are not always sure what happens.

Netflix News! [They want to block VPNs](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/netflix-will-block-vpns-for-now-but-its-real-goal-is-global-tv/) and they have many, [many genres](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/).

Now, go forth and have a good week.
