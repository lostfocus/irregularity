Hello internet friends!

I tried to block all "unsafe" traffic when using a public hotspot, but the web (including many of my own sites) are not prepared to handle a world in which port 80 is not allowed.  
And because I am very smart I disabled my SSH host before going on this trip.

Meanwhile in news from the future that we're living in:  

Apple Music is confusing enough that [even a big fan](http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/07/22/apple-music-is-a-nightmare-and-im-done-with-it/) manages to destroy his music library with it. He's famous enough that [someone at Apple helped](http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/07/24/i-got-my-music-back-at-least-most-of-it/) him, but not everybody has this option, do we?  

It is possible to [hack into cars](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) and do serious damage.

And maybe, just maybe, we need a new model for journalism that doesn't turn [a medium-length ranty article into a 7MB monster](http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/).  
I used to play games that simulated a whole season of Formula 1 that needed less space.

But hey, just small sidesteps on our way to [becoming a Type I civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc), right?

Be safe.
