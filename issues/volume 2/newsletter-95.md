Hello internet friends!

It's finally spring, which is good, because: sun!  
But it also means pollen and [being tired all the time.](http://monkeysandmountains.com/spring-fever-german-fruejahrsmuedigkeit) (tbh I don't need spring for that.)

The whole internet pre-ordered the Apple Watch last week. Nobody in my direct circle of friends did, though. I actually quite like how it looks like a tiny [Airstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstream) on a wrist, though.

Science news, now!  
*(The kind of "I heart science" kind of science, based on probably misunderstood reporting on actual science that real scientists have known for ages and/or are grumpy about the way it gets reported. You know, *science*.)*
