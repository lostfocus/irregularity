Hello internet friends,

when was the last time you thought about Enya? Precisely.  
Now she has a new album and because it's 2015 [the long portrait](http://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/the-keys-to-enyas-kingdom) doesn't appear in Vanity Fair but over on Buzzfeed.

If you are more into engines than Enya[^enen] you might want to watch [*the* top three of the current supercars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3YPTkBRaOk) driven around a race track in Portugal.

[^enen]: Those of you who know me in person can probably picture my smug smile over this lovely pun-ny segue.

If you're not interested in either of those, maybe you like [(long think pieces about) selfies](https://medium.com/matter/selfie-fe945dcba6b0)? Bring some time for that one, the reading time algorithm clocks this one at a whopping 57 minute read.  
Just imagine how many selfies you could have taken during that time.

Apparently there are [Millennial life coaches](http://www.vice.com/read/my-millennial-life-coach-v22n11) and I honestly don't know how to process that information.

> I celebrate everything! Even if you got on the call and said, 'I didn't do shit,' I'd be like, 'Wooo!'

Wooo. Well, I'm in.

If we still didn't know that podcasting is getting big - [just like in 2004 blogging got big](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/podcasting-in-2015-feels-a-lot-like-blogging-circa-2004-exciting-evolving-and-trouble-for-incumbents/) - here is [the Vogue podcast](http://www.vogue.com/13335624/vogue-podcast/).

Have a good week, people.
