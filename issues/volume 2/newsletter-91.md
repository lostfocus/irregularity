Hello internet friends!

Not only is Tinder more expensive for [people over 30](http://qz.com/353881/over-30-tinder-thinks-you-should-pay-more-for-its-premium-service/), [you'll probably also get hit on by advertising bots](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/tinder-users-sxsw-are-falling-woman-shes-not-what-she-appears-163486).  
Onwards!

By now you probably know that [Sir Terry Pratchett has passed away](http://m.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-31858156). He's always been one of my favourite authors and I do own all of his books, having pre-ordered every book as soon as that was an option.  
And then there is this delightful and very nerdy way to commemorate Mr Pratchett:[ sending a special HTTP header.](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/)

I am not a huge fan of ephemeral "social" live broadcasting - I was under the impression that the ability to time-shift media was one of the biggest achievement of the digital age. But even though I really don't understand Meerkat, the fact that [Twitter rained on their parade](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8213255/twitter-cuts-meerkat-off-from-its-social-graph-just-as-sxsw-gets) was a real dickmove.

Have a good week, everybody.
