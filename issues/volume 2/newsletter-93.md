Hello internet friends!

A day early and a very short one, I'm on the road tomorrow, but the email must go on!  
Onwards.

TED is… well, [what it is](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/opinion/sunday/the-church-of-ted.html). But what it also is is the place where Monica Lewinsky held her talk on [The price of shame](http://www.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame):

>"Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop," says Monica Lewinsky. In 1998, she says, “I was Patient Zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously.” Today, the kind of online public shaming she went through has become constant — and can turn deadly. In a brave talk, she takes a hard look at our online culture of humiliation, and asks for a different way.

It is worth reading how the comments to her talk turned exactly into [the point she was making](http://ideas.ted.com/want-to-help-prevent-online-bullying-comment-on-facebook/) - and how the community management at TED worked to turn the mood around.

What is wrong with people?

On the other hand, if you think that [this](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/cyberbullyings-got-new-target-big-companies-n331656) is cyberbullying, you're pretty silly.

Take care.
