Hello internet friends,

bad news! [The Robot Sex conference](http://loveandsexwithrobots.org/) in Malaysia ([remember?](http://irregularity.co/32-enjoy-the-silence/)) has been [cancelled](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34615532/love-and-sex-with-robots-conference-cancelled-in-malaysia).  
What I did learn from that article - besides that it is apparently not in the Malaysian culture to mate with machines - is that one of the guys behind that specific field of research is [Adrian David Cheok](http://adriancheok.info/), who those of you, who have been reading my newsletter for a while now, know from his very important work on [Poultry Internet Touching](http://irregularity.co/27-poultry-internet-touching/).  
(*This here is now the moment where you tell me you're proud of me for not making one of the* very *obvious puns involving the different meanings of the word "cock."*)

Something that I have actually never even considered: [Does being self-deprecating help or harm you socially?](http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/question/216709-does-being-self-deprecating-help-or-harm-you-socially)  
Given my very "active" "social life" I think I can answer that one without even having to read the article. (Which I did. I have so many *turns out*s to process.)

If you ever feel like you need to write a tech think piece but need some inspiration, why not [look here](https://medium.com/life-learning/30-of-my-favourite-tech-start-up-clich%C3%A9s-346f3f4871e5#.kfkcc4g1k). Your article should do well on Medium!

Based on last week's alien megastructure, which is [now being investigated](http://www.space.com/30855-alien-life-search-kepler-megastructure.html) more thoroughly - and will probably be soon forgotten outside of space nerd circles - there were a whole bunch of articles around the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox). For me it was always pretty simple - many people assume there might be old, ancient space-travelling races out there - but maybe we're just the first planet where life has gotten advanced enough to <del>invent selfie-sticks</del> <ins>look out into space</ins>? Given that [most earth-like worlds are still in their infancy or don't even exist, yet](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/most-earth-like-worlds-have-yet-to-be-born-according-to-theoretical-study), this might be an explanation.  
So I guess we better get out there.

Thanks again to the three people who read this ema… wait. Self-deprecating humour. Let me start again…  
Thanks again to the three people who sent me a nice reply to last week's email. *Turns out* you really liked that subject line. Well, so did I.
