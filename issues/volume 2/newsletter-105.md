Hello internet friends!

[This](http://www.airliners.net/photo/Japan-Airlines--/Boeing-777-289/2644907/L/) is a very pretty photo of a Boeing 777.

Why the sudden Boeing? I just finished reading [Skyfaring](http://www.skyfaring.com) - the book I mentioned [two weeks ago](http://irregularity.co/15-ho-ho-ho/). And now I am looking at aircraft pictures, because *nerd*.  
It's a good book, though.

Another book that made its rounds on the internet - or at least the part of the internet where I hang around - is Aziz Ansari's [Modern Romance](http://book.azizansari.com/). I am pretty sure it's also a good book, there is just one little thing: [The Problem with Aziz Ansari Writing a Book About Something Heâ€™s Never Done](http://splitsider.com/2015/06/the-problem-with-aziz-ansari-writing-a-book-about-something-hes-never-done/).

That's all I have for today. Stay safe.
