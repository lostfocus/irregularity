Hello internet friends!

I am sure by now you have read Paul Ford's "[What Is Code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)"?  
If not, you should - it is very well written and covers basically everything about code and software development in 2015 in a way that everybody understands.  
Well, probably not *everybody* but I am sure all of you will have no problems with it.

I didn't watch Jurassic World, yet - and I am not sure if I really want to. [Especially given how much Jurassic Park means to me.](https://lostfocus.de/that-thing-with-the-dinosaurs/)  
Now you might wonder - [what makes Jurassic Park such a damn good movie?](http://www.tor.com/2015/06/09/what-makes-jurassic-park-such-a-damn-good-movie/)

While we're being nostalgic for the 90s, here is [some trivia regarding the title song of Friends](http://www.avclub.com/article/rembrandts-ill-be-there-you-was-golden-albatross-220189).  
(Have fun trying to get song unstuck from your brain now.)

I'm switching my diet to [sauerkraut and kimchi](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11667407/Socially-awkward-Eat-sauerkraut-and-pickles.html) now - I'll be smelly but at least I won't care? I'm sure that's how it works.

Have a good week!
