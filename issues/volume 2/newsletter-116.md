Hello internet friends!

This week, there will be a lot of sweary links. So if you're offended by this, maybe <del>fuck off</del> <ins>read something else</ins>.

[What the fuck, Google?](http://fusion.net/story/193803/google-censors-swearing/)  

[Death to Bullshit](http://deathtobullshit.com/)  
I like the idea and the sentiment, but *maybe* it would be a good idea to not hide the links on [the blog](http://blog.deathtobullshit.com/) behind Tumblr redirects? (To be completely honest - I am a Tumblr user and have no clue if it is possible to disable those redirects. (And to be double honest, yes, I know that all links here are behind redirects, too. That's tinyletter and there is no way to disable that.))  
Anyway, yes.

[Twitterâ€™s Product is Fucking Fine](http://startupljackson.com/post/128504446315/twitters-product-is-fucking-fine) - it is, really. Just maybe some more power to the API, so that Third-Party-Clients can really shine and then go ahead, build some more random products that I don't have to use.

And then here is [President Bartlet putting on his jacket](https://youtu.be/l8BzByjH4q0). A lot. And why does he do it? Well, Martin Sheen has limited movement in his left arm, so that's how he puts on jackets. As he did [back in 1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOhDvz7ETC8).

[Does that look clean to you?](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/07/travel/airplane-airport-germs/index.html)

Be safe.
