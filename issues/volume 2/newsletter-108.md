Hello internet friends!

Did you ever want to touch a hologram? Well, [now you can.](http://fusion.net/story/163260/japanese-scientists-are-developing-touchable-holograms-to-bring-us-better-virtual-pop-stars/) It is a bit scary, though:

> [â€¦] earlier iterations of plasma holograms burn human skin upon contact.

I am sure there is a whole subculture somewhere devoted to exactly that.

Apparently [it is possible to see polarization.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/07/01/sixth-sense/) I couldn't quite get it work, but then I see so many weird things when looking at nothing, a bunch of [blue and yellow bow-ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger%27s_brush) might get lost in the noise.

It is possible to [send an email to a tree in Melbourne](http://www.citylab.com/tech/2015/07/when-you-give-a-tree-an-email-address/398219/).  
This might be the best possible use case for email.

I mean, right after this email, right? Right?

Take care.
