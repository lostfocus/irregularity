Hello internet friends,

*somehow my paragraph on the current event in Paris and everybody's reaction to it got a bit longer. Since I understand that many people want or need to avoid articles about the more traumatic news, I put it out as an addendum. You can find it here: [Capital-O Opinion](http://irregularity.co/capital-o-opinion/).*

For everybody else, let's try to keep this one a bit lighter for now, okay?

Apparently [English is a pretty weird language](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages). But obviously [not as much as the author claims](http://www.metafilter.com/154725/English-is-not-normal), notes the always helpful geek choir called MetaFilter.

[The Internet Will Always Suck](http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2015/11/cory-doctorow-the-internet-will-always-suck/) - and because we're trying it with a lighter mood, this one is about the technical infrastructure and not the people.  
In case *technical infrastructure* made you roll your eyes and think: "ugh, nerd!" - enjoy this [helpful guide on how to handle electricity](http://sobadsogood.com/2015/11/01/helpful-1930s-guide-how-avoid-electrocuting-yourself/).

Apparently [a bunch of hotels are worth 12.2 Instagrams](http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2015/11/16/marriott-starwood-takeover-implications/).  That's pretty amazing.

I've been playing [the new Tomb Raider](http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/11/9712168/tomb-raider-lara-croft-sex-symbol-icon) game all weekend (in case you wonder if I have a lifeâ€¦) and it is [so choice](http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/9/9633858/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-one-crystal-dynamics-square-enix). If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.

Take care, everybody. Breathe. Hug a tree or a fellow person, if you're so inclined.
