Hello internet friends!

[Beware the owls of March!](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/14/eagle-owl-caught-dutch-town-attacks-purmerend-netherlands)  
Well, March is over soon, so we should be relatively safe. Onwards!

Ever since I learned about them on [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/136992/Normcore-millennials-reject-individualism-for-inclusion) I have been fascinated with [K-HOLE](http://khole.net/) and their reports. (And I am sure by now you have heard of and have gotten sick of "Normcore" - which might just be the group's "Funkytown".)  
So I was pretty excited when I found [a talk](http://www.walkerart.org/channel/2015/insights-k-hole-new-york) they gave at the Walker Art Center. It's rather long for the kind of attention span we have these days, but it easily beats [watching a bunch of TED talks](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/opinion/sunday/the-church-of-ted.html).

This one is pretty delightful: [The Secret Lives of the Tiny People In Architectural Renderings](http://gizmodo.com/the-secret-lives-of-the-tiny-people-in-architectural-re-1660746735).  
Look at all those tiny people!

I am still pretty sad that Terry Pratchett passed away - it is a bit of a ray of sunshine that he apparently managed to finish one last novel last year. It's a Tiffany Aching novel, called "The Shepherd's Crown" and will be published [later this year](http://io9.com/theres-one-more-terry-pratchett-book-still-to-come-1691712209).

Have a good week, everyone!
