Hello internet friends,

let's open with a strong contender for the headline-of-the-year award: [Wife crashes her own funeral, horrifying her husband, who had paid to have her killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/05/wife-crashes-her-own-funeral-horrifying-her-husband-who-had-paid-have-her-killed/)  
What a story.

Everyone on Twitter is mad about the company's idea to move to an *algorithmic* timeline which showcases *relevant* tweets. Apparently [this is how it works](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/6/10927874/twitter-algorithmic-timeline) and *tbh* I think it's a bit silly - the last time I saw a relevant tweet was probably 2010 anyway.

Last year had a lot of weird weather. [Here's a timelapse.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/watch-all-of-2015-s-weather-in-a-time-lapse-video/)

This is now bowling, this is 'Nam. And this time seen in [photos from a North Vietnamese perspective.](http://mashable.com/2016/02/05/another-vietnam-photography/)

[Man, I can't wait to be old.](http://qz.com/609982/you-wont-be-happiest-until-you-turn-65-years-old/) (At least where I am, 65 is also the age when most people retire? *Coincidence?*)

Nerd alert! Want to learn about CPU load averages? [Of course you do.](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/02/07/cpu-load-averages/)

And then there are a bunch of people trying to [clean the trash out of the ocean](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/02/01/can-the-largest-cleanup-in-history-save-the-ocean/). Go them!

Way back when ICQ was the biggest thing in the world I used to have an ICQ bot running with a simple markov chain. It would randomly add people[^randomicq] and talk to them and I had so much fun just reading those conversations. These days there are [much better libraries](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) for that kind of silliness and of course there is Twitter. So [here is a Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/botminik) markov chaining its way through my tweets.  
It does interact with people, too, so that's fun.

[^randomicq]: Remember that? It was possible to just randomly look for people on ICQ and then talk to them. Get me drunk and I'll tell you how *that* worked out for me.

Take care!
