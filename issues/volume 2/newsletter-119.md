Hello internet friends!

*The Internet* has been a bit weird last week. First *they* said [selfies are more deadly than sharks!](http://mashable.com/2015/09/21/selfie-deaths)  But then suddenly: [Selfies are *not* more deadly than sharks!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/22/no-selfies-have-not-killed-more-people-than-sharks-thats-ridiculous/)  
Sharks!

Kittie has been around for [20 years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTYfvY7L9I)? Now I feel old.

The Concorde [will fly again](http://flightclub.jalopnik.com/concorde-will-fly-again-says-group-with-massive-war-ch-1731681175)! But [really](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150925-how-do-you-bring-an-aircraft-back-from-the-dead)?  
I don't know, maybe it would be a better and probably easier idea to build a new supersonic airplane instead?

Meanwhile in the department of "sure, why not:" [We Asked a Cultural Historian: Are Apple Stores the New Temples?](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/we-asked-a-cultural-historian-are-apple-stores-the-new-temples)  
I am happy when cultural historians have neat little side jobs and sure, yes, temples.

Take care. And: The first of you who sends me a selfie with a shark wins a price!
