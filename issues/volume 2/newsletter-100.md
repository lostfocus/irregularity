Hello internet friends,

I'm usually a pretty calm person but when the first thing I see on a Monday morning is an email with the "important" flag, I do feel myself turning big and green.  
What's wrong with these people?

If you need around 12 minutes of *emotional hygiene*, I have good news for you: out of nowhere [a new episode of You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/episode/vintage-vape) appeared. (This is a good thing.)

[Wait, what?](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/feds-say-banned-researcher-commandeered-plane/)  
If this is true, it's pretty bad for everybody involved.

Remember 30 Rock? Of course you do. Now someone got hold of the [complaints](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/may/15/30-rock-fcc-complaints/) about it and I am not too sure if these aren't satire, too.

Given that we take more photos nowadays than ever before, interesting new applications emerge: [Using millions of online photos cobbled together, we can now watch history unfold](http://qz.com/406497/using-millions-of-online-photos-cobbled-together-we-can-now-watch-history-unfold/).  
This is actually pretty amazing - and a good reason to make sure we have good and robust archival systems and proper licences for these photos.

Eat some fruit and take care.
