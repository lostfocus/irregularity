Hello internet friends,

I actually quite enjoy flying. I like airports[^exceptions] and I am fascinated by the machinery and logistics of the whole system. I don't mind sitting in a tube with a whole lot of people, breathing recycled air and never feeling quite comfortable, because after all - hello! flying! - but even this might have its limits. And nowadays these limits are being closed to being reached - with the first few airlines pondering [non-stop flights from Europe to Australia](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/02/19/non-stop-flights-from-europe-to-australia-coming-soon/).

[^exceptions]: With some exceptions. But isn't that always the case?

I happily use Tumblr without thinking too much - I look at a bunch of photos on my dashboard, reblog a bunch, like some, yay. Except for the fact that I am quite annoyed that they took away the comment feature, Tumblr is where I go for mindless but always positive time wasting.  
This might be a sign of my age, though - because for young people, [Tumblr is serious business](https://newrepublic.com/article/129002/secret-lives-tumblr-teens).

I did [mention her before](http://irregularity.co/11-upward-mobility/), but since I see her face almost every day, here we go again, [a new article about Ariane, the stock model who is everywhere](http://womensrunning.competitor.com/2015/10/just-for-fun/the-worlds-most-famous-fitness-model-youve-never-heard-of_47395). And apparently [this is her Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/supersmileyariane/). ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Good news! [Drinking more coffee may reverse liver damage from booze.](http://nypost.com/2016/02/18/drinking-more-coffee-may-reverse-liver-damage-from-booze/)

I had Chris Dixon's [What's Next in Computing?](https://medium.com/@cdixon/what-s-next-in-computing-e54b870b80cc) sitting open in a tab all day and now that I scrolled over it - come on, lol, reading the whole thing? - I will recommend that you read through the article. After all, the future of computing is also very much the future of our lives.  
And me personally? Maybe I'll see how I can retire to some remote island and/or mountain, far away from all these things.

Let's learn about [the secret double meanings of emoji](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/02/19/the-secret-meanings-of-emoji/)! And then have another coffee and a good week ahead.
