Hello internet friends,

let's have a nice 2016, okay? Okay.  
So.

Maybe [don't call chuchuk a horse penis](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-04/briton-faces-jail-after-comparing-kyrgyz-delicacy-to-horse-penis/7065980), British dude.

I'll probably read [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/03/put-off-procrastinating-forever-tips-on-being-more-productive) some time later, we'll see. (And hereby recycling the joke that basically everybody who linked to this, made.)

Just around Christmas Mailchimp sent an email out to their customers with the *exciting* teaser that we could find out how much coffee they drank in 2015. I'm not sure anyone *really* cared. (In case you wonder: ***I*** had 546 cups of coffee in 2015, including espressi. Which is actually a surprisingly low number, not even reaching 1.5 cups of coffee/day.)

It is pretty amazing how many owners [some aircraft](http://imgur.com/gallery/zHlDK) go through before they are put out of service.  
Just look at that beautiful Singapore Airlines livery on the first picture.

If you make or consume websites in one way or another, you might be interested in Maciej Ceg≈Çowski's [talk on big, heavy websites](https://vimeo.com/147806338). ([Here's the transcript](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm), if you don't want to watch a big, heavy video.) It is really worth watching/reading.

Take care, people. And maybe [clean out a bit](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-origin-story-of-marie-kondos-decluttering-empire). (I know I should.)
