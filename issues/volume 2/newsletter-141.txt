Hello internet friends,

seems like Mr DiCaprio finally got his pity oscar.  
Congratulations.

Most people don't know this, but this newsletter is now a well-funded startup in a swanky loft office with exposed brick walls. "Dominik, how is this possible?" you might wonder and I am not above sharing my path to success: [Motivational posters.](https://medium.com/slackjaw/motivational-startup-taglines-you-can-print-out-and-stick-on-the-exposed-brick-in-your-office-ab20f75941a4)  

Did that make you laugh? [I have bad news for you.](http://qz.com/621522/what-makes-you-laugh-says-a-lot-about-who-you-are/)

Back in the days when we had to walk uphill through the snow both ways and all we had was crappy shareware games, I used to play some sort of [fighting game with robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Must_Fall:_2097). The Japanese decided to [make it real](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/watch-the-championship-round-of-japanese-hobby-robot-wrestling) - and honestly a lot more awesome.  
Just look at that chicken robot. A lot less scary than that [Boston Dynamics robot](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2016/feb/25/how-real-is-that-atlas-robot-boston-dynamics-video).

There is [a new Raspberry Pi](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/raspberry-pi-3-has-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-64-bit-chip-still-just-35/) in town, this one with WiFi and Bluetooth on board. By now the specs look good enough to replace most office computers - for a fraction of the price. I'm not sure what happened to the idea of running Windows on these things, though.

Or well, we could just put these things into animals and create [cyborgs](http://qz.com/618871/watch-a-cyborg-rat-could-point-the-way-to-a-post-ai-future/). (This one might actually be more scary than the Boston Dynamics robot.)

Sleep well.
