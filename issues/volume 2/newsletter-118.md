Hello, internet friends!

Last week we were all excited about ad blocking, then we stopped being excited about it, and yet there are so many ~think pieces~ on the web about it right now and I'm not going to link to a single one of them.  
That being said, if you want to advertise to a self-selected group of very smart and highly attractive people, I might find space for an ad spot here in this very newsletter!

So now someone started building [clothes that are part of the Internet of Things](http://qz.com/504499/the-intel-powered-wings-on-this-dress-expand-when-your-adrenaline-spikes/) and I'm all for it.  
I'd just wait for a while - if they work as well as my Wemos, they stop working [when you need them the most](https://lostfocus.de/12963-2/).

Since we're in the future already, [let's look at *Cyberpunk Real-Time Chess*](http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/09/16/japanese-team-combines-technology-with-centuries-old-game-to-reinvent-chess-for-a-cyberpunk-era/). I'm getting a heart attack just watching this, I can't even properly play StarCraft 2 on the slowest setting.

Regarding the future: maybe we should stop putting our penis in almost everything, [especially not in robots](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118482).

Another thing we shouldn't even think about starting: 

> [THIS STORY](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/bjarke-ingels-2-world-trade-center-wtc) IS being previewed exclusively on Apple News until Tuesday, September 22nd. 

Well, no, Wired. Don't.

If you want to read the three proper articles that I linked to on your Kindle, you can get them as an e-book-thing [here on Readlist](http://readlists.com/c74c5197).  
It's an experiment, [the idea blatantly stolen from Caitlin Dewey](http://tinyletter.com/cdewey/letters/links-weekend-edition-be-cool), who sends *her* newsletter every day.

Until next week, take care.
