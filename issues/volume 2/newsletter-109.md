Hello internet friends!

Nine (nine!) years ago, [my first tweet](https://twitter.com/dominik/statuses/12155).  
I feel old. A *lot* has happened in those nine years. And yet, here we are.

Cheated on your spouse lately? Maybe using *~the internet~*? [Well, bummer.](http://fusion.net/story/169457/ashley-madison-hacked/)

I am always fascinated by a good map. So I found it even more fascinating that there are apparently [awesome secret Soviet maps](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/secret-cold-war-maps/) around.  
The temptation to order a bunch for a *super secret project* that I am working on is pretty high.

Now go and have some ice cream.  
Yes, even if you're in the southern hemisphere, ice cream is nice all year around.
