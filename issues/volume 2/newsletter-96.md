Hello, internet friends!

Remember how [the Swiss police arrested a robot in January](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/random-darknet-shopper-seized/) for ordering illegal substances and fake passports? ([Vol.1 Issue 83](http://irregularity.co/83-ramen-in-space/))  
Well, *turns out* - [the charges have been dropped](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/in-europe-robots-can-legally-buy-drugs-online-for-art).  
(I mean of course, duh, [Switzerland](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/30/drugs.chemistry).)

[The Internet of Things](http://weputachipinit.tumblr.com/) will soon be upon us! I am sure some of these are parody and/or performance art.

Fun fact: in an attempt to catch up with the unevenly distributed future, I finally managed to see a 3D printer last week.  It was an [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com/) which mostly produced weird strings of hot plastic and a lot of smell.  
Maybe the future is still a bit more in the future?  
In related news, the [original Open Source 3d printing company MakerBot seems to be in trouble](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/makerbot-just-laid-off-20-percent-of-its-staff). Apparently [because of the Osborne Effect](http://www.hugs.io/2015/04/18/makerbot-and-the-osborne-effect.html).  
Stupid comic book movies have infiltrated my brain enough to look at that article's headline and wonder what the Green Goblin has to do with it. (Then I remembered his name doesn't have that "e" at the end.)

Oh, and apparently there has been some new space movie trailer. You have probably seen it.
