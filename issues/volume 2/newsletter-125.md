Hello internet friends,

here we go again. (♬ Here we go go go to the temple of consumption. ♫)

So far coffee is my only drug but [this](http://www.7deadlymag.com/kush/i-replaced-all-my-coffee-with-weed-k-cups-heres-what-happened/) sounds pretty good, too.

What is actually pretty good is the new Netflix series [Master of None](https://www.netflix.com/title/80049714) by and with Aziz Ansari. I watched it all in one go, which might have been excessive - but also doable, as the first season is just ten short episodes.  
Highly recommended - not only by me, the whole internet seems to agree. (Almost. There are always grumps.)

I'm not what one might call a ~millennial~ - but I'd honestly would consider living in something like [those new living situations](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/coliving/414531/) here. Just add a balcony and I'm there.  
As long as Elwood doesn't forget to bring me my cheese whiz.

Apparently [the whole Apple car thing](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/11/07/faraday-is-a-mysterious-billion-dollar-car-company-that-wants-you-to-believe-it-isnt-apple-probably-is/) is happening - or not. Maybe there really is a company called [Faraday Future](http://www.faradayfuture.com/) that suddenly has a lot of money from nowhere and very soon we have forgotten about it while Apple is still [trying to make the Apple TV happen](https://lostfocus.de/so-i-bought-an-apple-tv/).

Last week I got the feedback that this newsletter is not very democratic and/or a discussion mailing list. That's right and by design.  
If you do have something to share - comments, thoughts, links, etc. - I am happy to get replies to these emails and share interesting feedback, too. If email is not your medium - hah - you could blog your thoughts and link to the newsletter on [the archive page](http://irregularity.co/). If you don't have your own blog, it might be easiest to sign up for Medium dot com and reply directly to the newsletter on [my archive over there](https://medium.com/irregular-archive).  If you're more of a tumblr person, there is [this](http://irregularityco.tumblr.com/).  
There are *all* the options - I do try to accommodate your ways of saying hi.

Now, be safe. And don't forget about those shark selfies - I'm still waiting for a real shark.
