Hello internet friends!

Yesterday I realized [I need a man-purse](https://lostfocus.de/100-words-029/).  
I was about to leave for a family gathering, wanted to swing by one of the few magazine stores with an international press section to get the [new Monocle](http://monocle.com/magazine/issues/85/) and I was also worried that the ageing battery of my iPhone would not make it through the day,[^battery] so I wanted to bring my battery pack.  
But the smallest bag I have to carry things is [my computer backpack](http://www.ospreyeurope.com/de_de/view-by-series/everyday-commute/portal-series/pixel-1), which is pretty small these days - a MacBook doesn't need that much space - but it is still too big for that purpose.  
Anyway.

[^battery]: I was right about that one. Crossing country-lines, being in a rural area with spotty reception equals crazy energy consumption of the phone.

I am one of those (snobby?) people who prefer to watch movies and series in their original language - yes, even if I don't understand it. That's why they invented subtitles. And while I still miss out on subtleties this way, I at least get the tone of the voices the way they were meant to be.  
The Verge has [a great article](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8809723/jerry-seinfeld-tv-show-international-translation) showing how hard it is to translate and dub a TV series for a German audience, using Seinfeld as an example.

More naps!
