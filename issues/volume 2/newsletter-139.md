Hello internet friends,

my usual writing tool - Byword - is crashing on me today, so I have to write this email in a normal text editor. Like an animal!  
Quite a minor incovenience, just imagine instead I had a G(r)eek Chorus that kept telling me how I should be [better all the time](https://medium.com/@randileeharper/putting-out-the-twitter-trashfire-3ac6cb1af3e). I mean, [seriously](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/technology/twitter-to-save-itself-must-scale-back-world-swallowing-ambitions.html?_r=0).  
Onwards.

Runkeeper - which I personally use as a Walkkeeper and Sleepkeeper - is [part of Asics](https://medium.com/runkeeper-everyone-every-run/runkeeper-and-asics-are-joining-forces-eae4d7a510c5) now. This is pretty amazing, let's see what they do with it.

> Perhaps [spending a night or two with a Neanderthal](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/11/10966912/neanderthal-dna-influence-skin-nicotine) was a relatively small price to pay for getting thousands of years of adaptations.

How about I put this in my OKCupid profile?

Do you know about the Sleng Teng Riddim? Me neither, but here you go, the unlikely story how [a Japanese lady over at Casio influenced reggae](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/04/casio-and-the-sleng-teng-riddim/).

Take care, everybody, thanks for reading.
