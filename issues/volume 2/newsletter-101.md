Hello internet friends!

My Apple Watch (No, I am not going to be all fancy and look up the UTF-8 for the Apple icon. Honestly.) arrived last week pretty much right after I sent the last email. And as [I posted to Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominik/status/600705614055104512) on Tuesday: 

> I already developed capital-O opinions.

But I realised pretty soon: this does not matter the least. Because as soon as people notice the watch on my arm, *they* have *all the opinions.*  
It's a waste of money, obviously. And a first generation product, ugh! And "Oh, it can tell the time? *How innovative.*"

It is actually fascinating. I am pretty sure that a Pebble or one of the Android watches would not even remotely create these sometimes pretty passionate reactions.  
Oh well. I quite like the watch - it tells the time and it vibrates in a weird way when someone sends me an iMessage.

Remember when *the internet* went crazy because it was raining spiders somewhere in Australia? *[Turns out](http://www.livescience.com/50856-spider-rain-explained.html)* that is actually pretty common and could happen in your area, too!  

Sweet dreams.
