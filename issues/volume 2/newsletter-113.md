Hello internet friends,

I didn't watch [this documentary about the Kowloon Walled City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_8ucS3lMY), yet, but it has been highly recommended, so here you go. I'll make sure to watch it later today.

Because we all like long and well-written articles, here is one about [hacking, gentrified](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/how-yuppies-hacked-the-original-hacker-ethos/):

> Thus the emergent tech industry’s definition of ‘hacking’ as quirky-but-edgy innovation by optimistic entrepreneurs with a love of getting things done. Nothing sinister about it: it’s just on-the-fly problem-solving for profit. This gentrified pitch is not just a cool personal narrative. It’s also a useful business construct, helping the tech industry to distinguish itself from the aggressive squares of Wall Street, competing for the same pool of new graduates.

I had altogether too much fun with [Pablo](https://buffer.com/pablo). (A sentence I did not think I would ever write.)

And then I am really looking forward to [the next season of Fargo](https://youtu.be/HSX5kMM8rpE).

Have a good week, everybody.
