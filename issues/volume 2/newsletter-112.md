Hello internet friends,

I really like [this bridge](http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/society/70067/inauguration-of-world-s-largest-dragon-shaped-steel-in-da-nang.html) and would advocate for all bridges being shaped into fire-breathing dragons.  
Given the headline - "world's largest dragon-shaped steel bridge" - one wonders where all the smaller dragon-shaped steel bridges are. Maybe there is a whole subculture of bridge builders who are into dragons?
