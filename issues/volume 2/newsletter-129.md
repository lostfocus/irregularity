Hello internet friends,

![](http://irregularity.lolproject.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/overcado-243x300.jpg)

a couple of weeks back we all had a light chuckle when we saw this pullquote regarding avocados.  
Which we then forgot again, because internet lols are in endless supply. When I saw it again, I tried to find the [whole article](http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/05/the-avocado-is-overcado-how-culture-caught-up-with-fashion) and I have to say, it really delivers:

>  I mean, no offence to Stephen Hawking, Iâ€™m sure black holes are also a big deal in their own way but, if you really want to get to grips with the meaning of modern life, look no further than the avocado. 

Chapeau. And onwards.

If you work on the internet, it might be interesting to know [What Web Can Do Today](https://whatwebcando.today/).  

> We are at a crossroads of purpose and pain. Our conversations with other travellers have led to an awakening of ultra-intergalatic consciousness. Humankind has nothing to lose.

I enjoy this [New-Age Bullshit Generator](http://sebpearce.com/bullshit/) just a tiny little bit too much. It's from those people who decided that studying these "profound" statements was a good way to spend their time. And well, [they were not wrong](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-find-a-link-between-low-intelligence-and-acceptance-of-pseudo-profound-bulls-a6757731.html).

Sometimes I watch SNL stuff, when it appears somewhere online. [This sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfPdYYsEfAE) is probably the funniest lately. *They were really respectful about it.*

Take care and maybe have a laugh or two.
