Hello, internet friends!

If you aren't yet, you might want to consider watching "[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_Kimmy_Schmidt)" - it is really, really good.

[The Cost of Paying Attention](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/the-cost-of-paying-attention.html?nytmobile=0) 

&bull;

And yes, I did just recommend a series on Netflix, where you basically have to pay for the privilege of not being advertised to. (At least not overly so.)  
That's how things are now.

If you had any doubt that we are living in the future, here is a woman [flying a fighter jet simulator with her mind](http://defensetech.org/2015/03/02/this-woman-flew-an-f-35-simulator-with-her-mind/). That is pretty great - except, you know, maybe not do that with military hardware? But I guess that's where the money is.

Have a good week, everybody.  
We'll get through this together.
