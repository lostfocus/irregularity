Hello internet friends!

What a nice, beautiful Monday it is!  
Oh, wait. Never mind.

It's very Snowfall-y, but nonetheless a very compelling read on the beauty of flying: [In Flight - en route from London to Tokyo, a pilotâ€™s-eye view of life in the sky.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/14/opinion/14-in-flight-mark-vanhoenacker.html)  
It's taken from a book that I have moved very high on my "to read" list.

(Snowfall-y? [Well](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/).)

It's summer and that means it's a good time for rum-based drinks. While enjoying one of those, it might be interesting to learn a bit about [the geopolitics of rum.](http://warontherocks.com/2015/06/the-geopolitics-of-rum/?singlepage=1)

And once you're nicely drunk, you might be in the mood for some pretty weird and often weirdly pretty television. So why not give [Sense8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8) a try? Many critics seemed to be on the *meh* side of things but I found [one](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8673391/sense8-review-matrix-wachowskis-netflix) who pretty much agrees with me.  
And as we all know, that's the most important quality in a review, right?

Have a good week!
