Hello internet friends!

I'm back from a week in [Berlin](http://skift.com/2015/05/08/berlins-tourists-are-more-geek-than-cool-more-business-than-party/) and at [re:publica '15](https://re-publica.de/15) and now have to face reality again. What a bummer.

I did get some valuable in-person feedback to especially this email thing here, so here we go:

* Yes, I do like it when people reply to these emails. I don't expect it, but I appreciate it. (It does happen quite regularly, too - thanks a lot for that!)
* I do have another newsletter, which is more or less automated - it is the links that I posted to [my link blog](http://the-firehose.com/) in the last 24 hours in a nicely (I hope) formatted daily email, so you can enjoy the fact that I read a lot of stuff on the internet and maybe find something worth reading. I was told to cross-promote it here, so here you go: if you want, you can [subscribe to that email here](http://eepurl.com/bg8Aqj).
* Nobody noticed that I actually spend money on a photo of [Ariane, The Overexposed Model](http://overexposedmodel.tumblr.com/) a few weeks back. You know, [the one who is everywhere](http://www.glamour.com/fashion/blogs/dressed/2013/10/the-most-famous-model-in-the-w). I even [found her](https://instagram.com/p/2dX4FyI5uB/) in the U-Bahn in Berlin. She's been around as well and [Mike Aquino at Esquire talked to her](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ariane-the-overexposed-stock-image-model/the-original-ariane-expose-article/530140707048004) a couple of years ago.

Light housekeeping out of the way, here is the story about [how Osama bin Laden really died](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden). Maybe. It's now what I learned from [that Homeland episode with another actress](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790885/).  
My gut says that this article is closer to the truth than "the official version" but that sounds pretty ton-foil-hatty and is mostly because *the media* (hah.) has instilled in me the knowledge, that a story is never quite as neat and clean as it seems and often a lot murkier.  
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Related, if you understand German, [this re:publica talk by Friedemann Karig on the fluidity of truth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFgW2xhcQg).

As much as I enjoyed many of the stupid superhero movies lately, I do agree with Sady Doyle here: [Age of Robots: How Marvel Is Killing the Popcorn Movie](https://medium.com/@sady_doyle/age-of-robots-how-marvel-is-killing-the-popcorn-movie-1e21b231f73a)  
Maybe scaling things down a bit would help the whole thing. In fact I do enjoy their TV outings - Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter - quite a bit more than I liked Age of Ultron. (Maybe because I was able to watch those while lounging around in my underwear.)

Now try to get that image out of your head, take care.
