Hi internet friends,

[I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/new-yorker/)

[Don't be like Bill.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/01/21/you-absolutely-should-not-be-like-bill-the-smarmy-stick-figure-meme-eating-facebook/)  

Space News!  
The alien megastructure that is probably a bunch of comets is [probably not a bunch of comets](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28786-comets-cant-explain-weird-alien-megastructure-star-after-all/).  
Apparently there is [a planet in our solar system](http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-researchers-find-evidence-real-ninth-planet-49523) that we don't know about. I'm not sure why they insist on calling it Planet Nine, though. You heard about Pluto? That's messed up, right?

Chicken News!  
[When chickens go wild](http://www.nature.com/news/when-chickens-go-wild-1.19195) is an interesting article about wild chickens on Kauai. There is also an amusing gif.

T-Shirt News!  
[Someone bought 800 t-shirts and measured them](http://www.threadbase.com/unravelled). And washed them and wore them and measured them and washed them and… (Not a single someone, obviously.)

Tennis News!  
Remember [last week's tennis kerfuffle](http://irregularity.co/47-game-set-match/)? (I almost forgot, tbh.) Well, apparently “[that’s what tennis players do](http://www.buzzfeed.com/robstott/tennis-racket-nick-lindahl)."

Racist News!  
*Turns out* you're [just as racist as everybody else](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3055662/smart-people-are-as-racist-as-less-smart-people-but-smart-enough-to-hide-it), you are just better at hiding it. Well, at least if you're a white American, which - let me look at my subscriber statistics - you are probably not.

Be safe, be less racist and maybe have a tea.
