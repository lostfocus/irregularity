**Hello, internet friends.**

I'm not too sure if it is genetics or an upbringing with a lot of moving around outside or maybe just the last remnants of youth, but I tend to be pretty robust when it comes to colds or becoming sick in general.  
So of course when a light fever hit me last week, I decided immediately that these are probably my last few days on earth. Once I made peace with that fact - it took me a surprisingly short time - I did, what every sane person would do in my situation:

Binge-watch season three of House of Cards.

Now I'm alive and well, so:

**Onwards.**

By now everybody is *so over* that color-changing dress - it's such old news that even Saturday Night Live made their jokes about it. Which probably means that I'll get a picture of it through WhatsApp by my relatives in about two weeks.  
I still did not manage to see it in blue and black, though, but then: who really cares anymore?

**Brands**

Brands care. For some reason, I *still* see white-and-gold-blue-and-black tweets from *brands* retweeted by people who I (held in higher esteem)used to?) hold in high esteem. I mean, I get it - haha, you're some [poor, tortured, over-paid Social Media Manager](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/i-tweeted-to-kids-as-a-piece-of-cheese-for-a-year), who needs to entertain the masses and promote a *brand* - but why do grown-up, smart people retweet these things? Because [virality](http://deadspin.com/the-quest-for-virality-is-making-everything-shitty-1683784595). 

**Help?**

Is anyone of your folks playing [Alto's Adventure](http://altosadventure.com/)? It's very pretty and just slightly frustrating. Which is probably a sign that I am Doing It Wrong.

Oh well.

Take care, eat some fruit, stay healthy.
