Hello internet friends,

I am quite a big fan of looking at screens, but the scenario how the couple in [this article](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-useless-agony-of-going-offline) consumes media/uses their devices scares even me.

Even though it is still absolutely inscrutable to me, the last two weeks peer pressured me into looking at Snapchat again. My post-snake-person[^millennial] cousin, [\#oldguyonsnapchat](http://periodically.co/2016/01/p102-the-adventures-of-oldguyonsnapchat/), and the good people at one of the many[^many] Slack chats *all* together managed what poor [Teymur](https://www.snapchat.com/add/teymur17) alone didn't manage to do.  
So, here we are. If you are a snap person, [add me](https://www.snapchat.com/add/lostfocus) and please - and now you have to excuse me for using the same old joke that *all* the old people who have only a vague understanding of *these new things* have, use - don't send me your genitals.

[^millennial]: How do we call these people? Oh, I know: *children* - for now.

[^many]: Are we at peak Slack, yet? We might just be, especially since I don't feel too happy about having [my corpus mined](http://venturebeat.com/2016/01/26/slack-forms-search-learning-intelligence-group-focused-on-mining-the-chat-corpus/).

[What would you do with your last day of internet?](https://www.good.is/features/last-day-of-internet)  
Now that's a fun thought experiment. The answers given in the article tend to be pretty boring, so here is mine, also pretty boring: Probably exactly what I do just now, trying to reach out to people. The internet is - and has been  for almost two decades now - a way for me to connect to my friends and peers and if it just went away, I'd have to re-learn all the ways that people use to connect offline.  
I might even have to use the phone to make calls, *ugh.*

Tempting: [Every 3 Months, I Unfollow Everyone on Twitter](http://elioverbey.com/every-3-months-unfollow-everyone-twitter/)  
But probably: no. That article is [via Lara](https://twitter.com/klicktrend/status/692721621984006144) who used it to justify following everyone I follow with her secondary account. It is a very special kind of hell to have a friend go through one's Twitter follows and live-slack that experience.

Now for something completely different:

> Think about an enormously muscled 1,500 to 2,000-pound animal, with horns the size of a full-grown man, which hangs out in herds of bored and testosterone-driven bachelor males, and has no fear of humans and no qualms about charging.

Have a good week - and [don't call Justin Bieber](http://www.racked.com/2016/1/25/10826024/justin-bieber-instagram-teen-pranks).
