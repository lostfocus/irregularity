Hello internet friends,

do *you* have a *~[personal brand](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122910/my-paradoxical-quest-build-personal-brand)~*?  
I apparently[^digfes] have one and it's a bit scary.

[^digfes]: Screenshot from [an article I wrote for Digital gefesselt](https://digitalgefesselt.de/menschen-sind-gewohnheitstiere/), which is not, unlike the name might suggest, a periodical for nerdy bondage fans.  
I think.

But maybe this will be a lot better once I use my army of sock puppet accounts to leave positive reviews of myself on Peeple, [which is the worst idea ever](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/30/everyone-you-know-will-be-able-to-rate-you-on-the-terrifying-yelp-for-people-whether-you-want-them-to-or-not/). (You can decide if "leaving fake reviews" or "a website to review people" is the worst idea ever. I can be ambiguous with my grammar here. [It's not a dating site](http://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-really-hot-on-dating-sites-proper-grammar-1443746849), after all.)

Apparently [silence is a luxury](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/how-silence-became-a-luxury-good/408412/) now. I'm mostly happy when it is not silent, because outside noise drowns out the voices in my head. (See also: podcast addiction.)

Remember two weeks back, that link about not having sex with robots? (Which, according to feedback I got, was "disturbing.") Well, apparently [these people](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/love-and-sex-with-robots-conference-in-malaysia-this-november) don't read my emails. Or the BBC website, but all four of you know which is one more widely circulated.

And I'm still waiting for those shark selfies.
