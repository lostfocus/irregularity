*Hey guys* ðŸ‘‹ *this is Dominik and today we'll learn about* [YouTube Voice](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/the-linguistics-of-youtube-voice/418962/).  
We'll probably also learn about emoji in newsletters.

Talking about emoji - apparently they are [not longer cool](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2015/12/emojis_are_no_longer_cool_in_japan.single.html) in [Japan](https://www.flickr.com/photos/megane_wakui/).

But who knows these days what actually cool is? Apparently the dude who decided to offer [a #swag course at an university](https://medium.com/hey-guys-lets-talk-about-cool-stuff-swag/the-swag-syllabus-69f41c636100).  
His "introduction to cool" begins with setting up Medium and Slack accounts, so that's, well, "cool." After all, I have both of these and I'm the definition of cool.

What I sometimes have, before I frustration-uninstall it again, is Snapchat. It is completely not made for my mental model of how ~the internet~ is supposed to work. [But maybe this might help?](http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/an-adults-guide-to-snapchat)  
It still doesn't, really.

Today in fun facts: It is quite likely that Stonehenge is a [second hand henge](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/07/stonehenge-first-erected-in-wales-secondhand-monument). It's quite nice that the Welsh didn't just throw it away but sold it to a bunch of Brits.  

Hey, everybody, let's try [this](http://mic.com/articles/128080/the-best-breathing-technique-to-help-you-sleep) at the office today!
