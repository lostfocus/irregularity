**1.0 Lifehack**
 
Don't use the bathroom before going to bed. Nothing helps you get out of bed faster in the morning than a certain amount of pressure.
 
**2.0 Shower music**
 
I tried listening to podcasts during my morning shower. I noticed pretty soon that I have trouble listening to people talk while water is flowing onto my head. So I checked the next possible source of audio entertainment on my phone and found Spotify.
 
My taste in music is very much "it depends" - something that tends to freak out fans of a specific genre of music. I am perfectly fine to listen to country music one day, dubstep the next one, classical music on the third day and trippy surfer music the day after that.   
Now I am really tempted to write a little script that runs around the time I am usually done with my morning rituals, checks if I listened to any music in the last hour, take one random song and post it somewhere.   
Useless? Yes. But it might be interesting and could even help someone discover new music.
 
Yay or nay?
 
**2.1 Wait, what?**
 
Yes, I listen to music from my iPhone while taking a shower. No, it's not in there with me, I'd be scared to have water damage. I'm a bit less scared for my little bluetooth speaker to have water damage, so that one is in the bathroom and the iPhone is outside, nice and safe. 
Maybe I should even consider spending money on a waterproof bluetooth speaker, then I don't have to crank it up to 11 to hear it on my side of the shower curtain.

Once we all use smartphones, nobody will understand why we put ones in our row of exclamation marks.
 
He said, not knowing where non-iPhone smartphones have the exclamation mark on their virtual keyboards.

This is what you get, it won't get any deeper or smarter.
 
Take care,
