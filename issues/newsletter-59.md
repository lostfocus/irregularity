Hello, internet friends!

I hope you're all doing well. It's Monday for me today, which is pretty convenient since it is Friday tomorrow - it's great how that works when you take three days off in a week.
Well, it still makes today a Monday.

For no apparent reason[^yolo] I travelled in First Class[^first] yesterday.   
At the time of booking it was not such a big difference but it was amazing what a hugely different experience I bought for less than what I sometimes spend on coffee. I got on the train in Köln and it was packed. Seats were all taken, people were sitting on the ground, crying babies - train travel business as usual, I figure. Not so much in the part of the train where I had my seat - basically nobody was in there, there were actually employees of the train company around and they were friendly and kept giving me[^me] candy.  
It wasn't quite Snowpiercer, but it was a pretty strange experience.

[Of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEY58fiSK8E) I used my leisurerly time in the couch-like leather seat mostly to complain on Twitter about how the high-speed wifi on the bullet train that took me halfway through Germany in under four hours wasn't working flawlessly all the time.

[^first]: Deutsche Bahn doesn't mess around with their naming scheme. You're either a first class or a second class traveller. No 'Economy' euphemisms.

[^yolo]: Which is the nice way of saying "YOLO" I guess.

[^me]: Not just me. The old man using his Surface Pro and the Yuppie family with the little boy and his iPad also got some. Yes, I recognize these devices. Nerd alert.

I don't know what to say about Social Media raffles that are based on using company's hashtags. I guess some person can then tell their #boss that the #brand #engagement went #through the #roof? Yeah, that will sell a couple of €100k cars. #hashtags.

Yeah, [a big bouquet of flowers](http://thenextweb.com/voice/2014/08/20/sexual-harrassment-tech-industry/) is going to fix that problem, buddy.  
(Seriously: WTF?)

◔̯◔ 

Be safe out there.
