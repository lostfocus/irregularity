Dear internet friends,

first a quick note to my male internet friends, who also happen to use the [Secret](https://www.secret.ly/) app: I sure hope it's just one of you guys who keeps posting those whiny borderline-MRA-type posts. Honestly, I had a better opinion of you.

Now on to follow-up! I got a [little analog kitchen scale](http://www.soehnle.de/produkte/kuechenwaagen/analoge-kuechenwaagen.html?sy_produkt[id]=19&cHash=5b5265adf1) and a measuring cup, so if for some reason I get too much sun again and decide to bake something, I am prepared!  
And talking about prepared - of course I was not left alone, scared and coffee-less after I broke my French Press. Thanks to my ever-growing collection of coffee making utensils, I managed to only be alone and scared.

And now, a bunch of links!

[The Baffling Genius of Jason Derulo](http://www.theawl.com/2014/06/the-baffling-genius-of-jason-derulo) - well, I learned about Balkan Beat Box that way and might have scared and/or confused my neighbors by listening to that on a rather loud level yesterday afternoon.

Well, that's one way to promote your service: [Uber is offering helicopter rides over Mumbai and Bangalore for $85](http://qz.com/220783/this-taxi-app-is-offering-aerial-views-in-mumbai-bangalore-this-weekend/) - hey, for that price, I'd take a helicopter for a trip once or twice a month, nbd.
