Hello, dear internet friends!

I hope all is well with you.

Instant gratification is the best kind of gratification - says the internet. So here is [Push for Pizza](http://welcome.pushforpizza.com) and here is an [article on re/code on instant gratification](http://recode.net/2014/08/04/i-want-it-and-i-want-it-now-its-time-for-instant-gratification/).  
It makes me slightly grumpy. Not because I am in the "In the olden days, we had to walk thirty kilometers through the snow to get a pizza! Uphill both ways!" camp that thinks hat instant gratification destroys all that is good and well but mostly because these things are probably not available where I am.  
Here it's Amazon Prime, two small food delivery services and a lot of "People, who don't hunt and grow their own food, are lazy and being lazy is morally wrong."

Tina Fey is the best, we can all agree on that, right? Good. So here's an old-ish article by her from the New Yorker: [Lessons from Late Night](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/14/lessons-from-late-night)  
I like "Never tell a crazy person he’s crazy." - I know. Just tell them, they're your internet friend and they'll be happy.

Remember when [OKCupid experimented on people](http://irregularity.co/55-hats/)? Well, the good thing is that it triggered Tim Carmody to write this article on why exactly this is wrong and why it's a problem with the whole social web these days: [The problem with OKCupid is the problem with the social web](http://kottke.org/14/08/the-problem-with-okcupid-is-the-problem-with-the-social-web)  
Related, if you want to hear the other side speak, here is the OKCupid dude on a (short, so just go ahead and listen, won't you?) podcast: [TLDR 32: An imperfect match](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/32-ok-cupid/). Lovely fella.

Have a good day, folks.
