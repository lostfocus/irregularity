Hello, internet friends!

I really don't have much to say today, so here is an email that looks like [my blog](http://solipsism.eu/) over on tumblr.[^tumblr]

[^tumblr]: I still can't get myself to say: "That looks like my tumblr."

(Hehe. A face palm in a dating app. Maybe a [date palm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm)? (I'm so, so sorry.))

Talking about Tumblr and Tinder: apps/websites whose main purpose is to meet people in a dating situation don't really work for me. Neither those where I have to write something smart or where I have to present myself with photos. Not only because I am not very good at selling myself this way but also because it's not the way I think of potential future partners.  
What I'd really like would be a dating platform that just links to people's Tumblr and/or Twitter account. It's really more interesting to see what people (re-)blog or tweet than to read the hundredth variation of "I like to travel[^travel] and do sports[^sports], my favorite band is Coldplay, I like to go crazy[^crazy] and please only write to me if you read all of this."

[^travel]: But not too much. It's nice at home, too.

[^sports]: But not too much. Maybe a bit of jogging. And it's only because I feel pressured by society to do it, really. But here we go: I like to do sports!

[^crazy]: But not too much. I'm in my late 20s now. But still, you know. Have a drink outside.

I rather see someone post a picture like this and have an instant connection through the shared interests in coffee and Twin Peaks.

Have a nice day. It's a public holiday here tomorrow, so: yay!
